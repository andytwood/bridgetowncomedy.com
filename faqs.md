**Can I buy individual show tickets?**

Yes! Well, sort of. This year we are selling [individual show tickets to the Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist 20th Anniversary Celebration](https://www.ticketfly.com/purchase/event/796489) on May 7th and [Live Wire Radio](https://www.ticketfly.com/purchase/event/772911?utm_source=TICKETBUTTON) on May 9th (SOLD OUT!), both at [Revolution Hall](http://www.revolutionhallpdx.com/). Apart from that, [we only sell full festival passes in advance](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/2015-bridgetown-comedy-festival-may-7-10-tickets-15878613360). The standard festival pass grants admission to all Bridgetown shows EXCEPT Dr. Katz and Live Wire, and the deluxe festival pass (SOLD OUT!) and Golden Ticket (SOLD OUT!) grant admission to all Bridgetown shows INCLUDING Dr. Katz and Live Wire (note that you must RSVP after purchasing a deluxe pass to secure seats at those shows).

Apart from that, if you want to attend a single show, you can pay admission as you enter (doors open 30 minutes prior to showtime). This has been Bridgetown’s policy in an attempt to avoid penalizing full weekend pass-holders. This way, no matter how popular a single show may be, those with festival passes and those who only want to attend one show have an equal chance at getting in by lining up beforehand.

Note: Individual show tickets are only valid for a single show. They do not grant access for any following shows in the same venue.

**So I bought a festival pass. What now? Where do I pick it up?**

If you bought a standard festival pass, deluxe festival pass or Golden Ticket VIP pass, you will get a wristband to wear throughout the weekend that grants you admission to shows. Your wristband and must be worn at all times -- if you remove or lose it, you will need to purchase a new one. To pick up your festival wristband, please bring a printout of your Eventbrite receipt, or show your receipt on your smartphone, or just show a valid photo ID for the name used for your order at any of the 2015 Bridgetown Comedy Festival venues (ONLY DURING THE FESTIVAL -- the venues will have will call for Bridgetown passes set up half an hour before shows begin). [This year's Bridgetown venues are listed here on a handy map](http://www.bridgetowncomedy.com/venues).

Note that we'll also allow early will call pickup on Wednesday, May 6th at Analog Cafe (720 SE Hawthorne Blvd.) from 6:30 - 9:00, as well as on Thursday, May 7th at Boogie's Burgers & Brew (910 E Burnside St.) from 4:30 - 8:00.

**I heard Obama is visiting Portland on Thursday and Friday. What gives?**

Bad timing, right? We're hoping POTUS doesn't interfere with Bridgetown transportation too much, but who knows? If you're looking for tips on avoiding Secret Service-related traffic problems, here's the [OregonLive writeup about Obama's visit](http://www.oregonlive.com/commuting/index.ssf/2015/05/obama_portland_visit_traffic_t.html) and [here's KATU's article](http://www.katu.com/politics/President-Barack-Obama-visit-to-Portland-this-week-to-cause-traffic-delays-302676791.html).

<br>

**Are tickets transferable?**

No. Your weekend wristband is meant to be worn by you and only you throughout the weekend. If you wish to transfer your ticket into someone else’s name before the festival, you may request to do so by emailing [info@bridgetowncomedy.com](mailto:info@bridgetowncomedy.com)
<br>
<br>

**Are all shows 21 and over?**

All of the shows in this year's festival are 21 and over.
<br>
<br>

**What does my Golden Ticket VIP Pass get me?**

Your VIP Golden Ticket pass grants you front-of-the-line access to shows, a free Bridgetown T-shirt, admission to the May 7th special event Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist 20th Anniversary Celebration, the May 9th Live Wire Radio show at Revolution Hall and the pre-festival meet-and-greet. If you purchased a Golden Ticket, you will receive an email a week before the festival with information on this event via the email address you used when purchasing your pass.

**Do certain shows forbid late admittance?**

It is a good idea to get to shows early to ensure entry. Once a show has sold out, you will not be able to enter. There may be certain cases that require waiting until a natural break in the performance before late entry is allowed.
