Late Late Breakfast is a wildly fun show created and co-hosted by comedians Danny Maupin and Tyler Jackson that blends regular standup performances with huge elements of chance, absurdism, and surprise. It’s fast-paced, we put up a ton of comedians, and even we don’t always know what’s going to happen from one set to another, based on the randomization of games.

For every show, we come up with a unique set of 15 “games”. Our games are different rules or challenges that a comedian must contend with while simultaneously performing their standup set. They’re often centered around a particular topic or theme for each show and we love tailoring game sets to individual shows and venues. Comedians pop balloons at the top of their set, which reveals their game. We read the name of the game, explain the rules, set it up, and then let the fun happen while the comedian performs.

Some favorite past games have included:
-Loading the entire audience onto a tour bus and having the comedian give an improvised guided tour of the neighborhood
-Blindfolding a comedian and having them tell jokes while also identifying different flavors of baby food
-Having the entire audience come outside to watch a comedian deliver their set while flying a kite
-The comedian leaves the venue and records their set as an audio file. They return to the venue at a later point in the show and lip sync to their own performance

We run two regular monthly Late Late Breakfast shows: one at The Hideout in Chicago and one at The Creek and The Cave in NYC. We’ve also brought it to several festivals over the past two years, including the New York Comedy Festival, Hell Yes Fest, and the Chicago Comedy Expo, and have been touring extensively. This has helped us develop a streamlined version of our normal show that works incredibly well at festivals and we&#039;d love to bring Late Late Breakfast to Bridgetown!
