Thanks to the miracle of science, very famous, extremely dead authors time travel to the present and are brought together to discuss their lives and works! But mostly, these dead authors fight like dead cats and dead dogs! And the audience gets to ask questions! That&#039;s you! YOU are the audience! I am saying you get to ask questions! INTERACTIVE!!!
