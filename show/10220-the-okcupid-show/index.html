We get a real guy from OkCupid and set him up on three blind dates with three real ladies from OkCupid - all live on stage. Amanda and Eli (and the audience) coach the guy through the awkwardness and obstacles of each date. As a bonus, each date is interrupted by some fictional character from the guys&#039;s past who just happens to be in the restaurant. 

The OkCupid Show has been running at UCB for almost four years now and we are currently working with Sony to develop it for TV.

This show is reality tv on stage. It is weird and awkward and intense and super hilarious. A funny car crash you can&#039;t stop watching.
