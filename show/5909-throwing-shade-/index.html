Throwing Shade is the irreverent weekly political/absurdist comedy podcast &amp; Funny or Die web series hosted by Upright Citizens Brigade alums and Funny or Die writers Erin Gibson and Bryan Safi. Join Erin and Bryan and laugh at things you’re not supposed to, in person, for a night that we promise will be better than prom.

Consistently in iTunes top ten comedy podcasts with a 5 star rating and with over 3 million downloads, Throwing Shade has cultivated a devoted and broad fan base - the LGBT community (homosensuals), savvy, smart ladies (feminasties), and straight dudes who “get it” (heterosensitives) - by using humor and absurdity to dismantle the unfair treatment of ladies and gays by politicians, the media, and people who don’t know any better.

Winner of Podcast Awards “Best GLBT Podcast” 2013
Named one of Paste Magazine’s top 20 comedy podcasts of 2013
&quot;Lacking any sort of filter, UCB veterans Erin Gibson and Bryan Safi are equal- opportunity offenders, discussing current events with a politically incorrect sense of humor. Their aggressively energetic personalities give the show a bit of a morning shock-jock feel, if shock jocks spent even more time talking about genitals.&quot; – The A.V. Club
