Comedian and repeat relationship failure Erin McGathy talks love, sex and all matters of heartbreak in the podcast version of her live show originally performed at the Upright Citizen&#039;s Brigade Theatre. Each week features a revealing, intimate and joyfully-terrible conversation with a different comedian friend, famous-ish person or drunk ex-boyfriend. Let&#039;s get terrible.
