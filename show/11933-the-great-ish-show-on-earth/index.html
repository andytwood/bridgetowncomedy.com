NAMELESS NUMBERHEAD is a sketch comedy duo made up by Maari Suorsa (original Off-Broadway cast of 5 Lesbians Eating a Quiche) and Henry Riggs (Jeff Award winning co-writer of That Sordid Little Story). The two are not only comedic partners but also a couple in real life. They met while studying improv in Chicago, Suorsa at The Annoyance Theatre and Riggs at iO. With backgrounds in theatre and music they create a more dynamic tapestry for their comedy shows. Their newest show is called “THE GREAT-ish SHOW ON EARTH?”, and follows a through line of today’s logged in, consumer focused, and media driven lifestyle. The two have performed as Nameless Numberhead at iO Chicago, The PIT NYC, Piccolo Fringe Festival, and The Charleston Comedy Festival.
