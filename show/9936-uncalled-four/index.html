Formerly known as &quot;Comics Against Civility&quot;, this comedy game show is loosely based on Cards Against Humanity. Four comedians create decks of 20 offensively hilarious ideas (&quot;Subjecting white people to actual suffering.&quot; or &quot;A burka for your fleshlight.&quot;) to answer audience cards suggested before the show. Audience members win prizes and serve as judge and jury to see which card is truly the worst (read: best) of the round. At the end of the 30 minute round, there&#039;s one final opportunity to wager points and determine which member of the panel is the most &quot;Uncalled Four&quot;. Each game opens with a stand-up portion featuring all performers. Please note that all social media and website accounts are currently being updated after receiving a nice cease and desist from Cards Against Humanity. Our legal team has assured us our new format is 100% legal.
