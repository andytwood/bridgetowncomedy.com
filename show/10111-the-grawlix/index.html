Based in Denver, Colorado the Grawlix consists of comics Adam Cayton-Holland, Andrew Orvedhal and Ben Roy. The three of us host the show with a sketch up top - sweet, sweet banter between the three of us - and then some standup with a video or two thrown in for good measure. After much experimentation we&#039;ve found that the up-front with the three of us, then a video, then pretty much a stand-up show after that (with the three of us taking turns MCing, usually with some running through-line we conceive on the fly) is the best way to pull this show off. We&#039;ve done The Grawlix at Bridgetown before, as well as SXSW, The New York Comedy Festival, Riot LA and the High Plains Comedy Festival. We also just filmed a pilot for TRU TV and by the time Bridgetown rolls around we could very well have had that pilot picked up so we&#039;ll be MEGA HUGE STARTS BUT STILL WITH HUMBLE ATTITUDES AND GOOD TIME VIBES.
