Comptroller Jeff Davis of “Whose Line Is It Anyway?” fame does his best to maintain order in this no-holds-barred town hall meeting. Celebrity and comedian drop-ins happen regularly and the story element of an ongoing game of Dungeon &amp; Dragons builds week to week, run by audience member turned Dungeon Master Spencer Crittendon.
