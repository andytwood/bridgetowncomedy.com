Created and hosted by Drennon Davis - 

From his elaborate characters and sketches, to his provocative songs and animation, Drennon Davis has made a name for himself as one of the most innovative minds in today’s comedy scene. His live performances of the festival favorite, The Imaginary Radio Program combine live music and beat-boxing with one-man sketches into a show that the Los Angeles Comedy Bureau writes &quot;not only lives up to its name, but exceeds expectation in what you could possibly think it is.&quot;

He was recently featured on Comedy Central&#039;s new show Adam Devine&#039;s House Party  and his new animated show The Long Legs can be seen on MTV&#039;s rebirth of Liquid Television.  He was recently featured in LA Weekly&#039;s Top 10 Comedy Acts to Watch in 2014.

Some love for Imaginary Radio Program:

“If you venture into this awkward yet ultimately rewarding late-night show, you may well come out of it thinking that Drennon Davis is a bit of a genius.” 
- The Times (UK)

“Tune in, for a show that&#039;s high on concept and adept in execution.” 
- The Guardian 

“If Davis isn’t the world’s foremost radio impressionist he’s definitely tuned somewhere near the top… The Imaginary RadioProgram may just be the most inspiring show about what you can create when your entire world revolves around radio, and not just your genitals.”
