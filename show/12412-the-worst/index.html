What is the worst? Well, some would say waiting in traffic, going to a parent teacher conference, or the films of Uwe Boll. The Worst, is a show dedicated to all of that. 

Our show started out as a bunch of stand up comedians who got bored of doing the same thing every night and thought that writing sketches would be fun. It has since transformed into a multimedia hodge podge of live sketches, stand up performances, musical acts, and videos ranging from man on the streets to mini documentaries. The whole show runs on a simple theme, basically if you&#039;ve ever referred to anything as &quot;the worst&quot; in exasperation, we probably have a sketch, or a video, or a musical number about just that. 

The cast of The Worst formerly performed as Don&#039;t Watch This Show: Live, which was named the Best Comedic Variety Show by SF Weekly in 2013. We performed in SF Sketchfest for 3 years and even won their video contest in 2014. We performed as The Worst at two sold out showcases in this year&#039;s festival. But that doesn&#039;t really tell the whole story. The Worst is 8 people working on something they love, and apparently what we love is borderline-absurdist sketch comedy. We strive to raise the bar for what people expect from a sketch comedy show. No topic is too touchy nor obscure and no stage is safe from being covered in anything from corn flakes to fake blood. 

We would also love to feature 1 or 2 guest comics to do sets during the course of the show and participate in a sketch or two.
