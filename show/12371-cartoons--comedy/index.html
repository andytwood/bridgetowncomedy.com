Cartoons &amp; Comedy is a fun nostalgic trip with lots of laughs.  I put together episodes of the best (and worst) cartoons from the 80&#039;s and early 90&#039;s and edit in the commercials from that time.  A panel of comedians riff on the show while the crowd enjoys free cereal.  Between and after the episodes I have the comics do short stand up sets with material related to growing up.  The show has been running for three years here in Denver and has been very well received.  At every show, someone yells out &quot;I had that toy!&quot; or &quot;Oh my god I totally forgot about that!&quot;  The mix of the cartoons, commercials and cereal really puts people back into a place of being a kid again.  It&#039;s a labor of love that has drawn such awesome guests as Chris Fairbanks, Sean Patton, Rory Scovel and Run Funches.
