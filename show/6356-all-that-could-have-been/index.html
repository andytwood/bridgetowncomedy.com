After going on strike from writing Fashion Police, I&#039;ve been submitting to tons of other shows trying to find work. I created this show for writers to read the submissions they&#039;ve written for television shows and magazines that never got them the job. We work really hard and sometimes never get so much as a &quot;thank you.&quot; If we&#039;re not going to be paid in money or employment, we might as well be paid in laughter! 
Last night was the first time I put the show up and it was a hit. I didn&#039;t get any video from the show, but I do have the opening video that I played at the beginning of the night. 
If this show gets selected for the festival, I&#039;m sure I could put it together with people that will already be there (I&#039;m assuming.) Like Bryan Cook, Eliza Skinner, Brock Wilbur, Solomon Georgio, and any other of my friends that are submitting. I think this show would be a great fit!
