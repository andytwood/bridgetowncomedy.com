The Kill Tony podcast is a live showcase of comedians talking about comedy while critiquing the performances of randomly selected comics who each perform 1 minute of comedy.  Host/creator Tony Hinchcliffe, along with producer Brian Redban, two guest comedians and band leader / sidekick Pat Regan talk about what went well, what needs work, tips for improving performances, stories of their own times starting out in comedy and jkoes amongst themselves in a unique experience that allows anyone who submits to potentially do comedy in front of and be mentored by some of the best comedians working.  Guests have included the likes of Marc Maron, Bill Burr, Sarah Silverman, Joe Rogan, and many others.  It&#039;s already gone for 133 episodes over the past 3 years and continues to rack up on average 100,000 listeners an episode, and around 250,000 at its peak. Tony, and often the other comedians on the show, are also on Periscope and getting feedback from their fans as the show goes on.
