It is the definitive guide to the illegal, immoral, and fun.  Everyone&#039;s cheating: Why not you? 

That&#039;s the gist of it...

About the show
&quot;Delectable one liners advising wealth before moral health... As funny and as quotable as anything that appears daily on late-night TV. You are guaranteed a few laugh-out-loud verbal souvenirs&quot;  - The New York Times

&quot;Hilarious... Kreisler nails the glad-handing &quot;just between us&quot; semi-conspiratorial tone of guru/salesmen such as Tony Robbins... His audience interactions are smooth and he knows how to stick the knife into our guts in the middle of a belly laugh&quot;  - Chicago Tribune

&quot;A Michael Moore-esque rallying cry... A really great performer&quot; - Time Out New York

&quot;Plenty of polished one-liners and wry observations&quot; - Time Out Chicago

&quot;Jeff Kreisler goes where other comics fear to tread (with) a zest missing from (other) shows... Reflections so clever, you wonder why they aren’t present in the political discourse&quot; - Fest
