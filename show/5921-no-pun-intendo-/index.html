Promotional Blurb: 

Gifted at gaming? Not gifted at gaming?  Who cares? Welcome to No Pun Intendo -  the Nerdist Theater’s first in house video game competition. If you’re there, you’re eligible to play. Produced and hosted by Ron Funches, David Cope, and Bette Bentley. Audience teams will be formed and battles will be fought featuring games like Soul Calibur, Super Smash Bros, and Street Fighter. Special comedian guests and grand prizes await - sponsored by Portland&#039;s very own Ground Kontrol. 

THE FACTS:

 - No Pun Intendo is a comedy gaming contest. Acting as team captains, Ron Funches and David Cope form teams from the audience and pit players against each other 
   on games we&#039;re playing live at the venue. That means we&#039;re bringing our Xbox down, plugging in, the whole nine yards. Comedian guests help mix things up as 
   gamers take each other on. David Cope&#039;s real life fiancé and producer at Funny or Die will be there for post gaming interviews. 

 - We&#039;re already a repeat performance at The Nerdist Theater in L.A. Our next show is January 24th.

COMEDIAN GUESTS: 

 - Our last comedian guests included Richard Bain and Brent Weinbach. On Jan 24th we&#039;re featuring Andy Peters and Josh Fadem. Given we&#039;re accepted for Bridgetown   
   this April,  David and Ron would likely find gaming enthusiast comedians already booked for Bridgetown who&#039;d already be in town and pumped to be part of a 
   gaming contest. 

NOTE: 

 - The poster we&#039;re supplying is the poster we&#039;ve been using to promote our prior shows. If we&#039;re accepted into Bridgetown we&#039;d update it with the current 
    performers.
