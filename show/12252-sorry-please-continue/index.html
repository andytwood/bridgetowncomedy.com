The show is a themed storytelling show. Every month, there is a theme, such as DATING or FAMILY. The Storytellers take turns telling their stories while a panel of comedians sit on a couch onstage and interrupt with jokes and questions and commentary. It is the most fun I&#039;ve ever had onstage, and so much fun to watch. Sometimes the stories are amazing on their own. Other times the story doesn&#039;t have much to it, but there are so many details that lead to amazing riffs from the panel. It is truly unpredictable and always a great time.
