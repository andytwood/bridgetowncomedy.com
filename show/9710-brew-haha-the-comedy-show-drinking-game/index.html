One part comedy show, two parts drinking game, Brew Haha is an interactive mix of standup comedy and your favorite pre-party ritual.  At the beginning of every show, the hosts tell fun stories from past parties and then introduce the crowd to a set of rules created specifically for that show.  When a comic, unbeknownst to them, breaks a rule, the audience drinks. A giant light-up “drink” sign will help the audience play along.  Examples of rules include, &quot;every time a comic uses a funny voice, or sings&quot;, &quot;every time a comic talks about a romantic relationship past or present&quot;, or &quot;every time a comic tries to guess a rule&quot;.  A second game, specifically for the performers, ensures that as the audience gets drunker, so do the comedians.
