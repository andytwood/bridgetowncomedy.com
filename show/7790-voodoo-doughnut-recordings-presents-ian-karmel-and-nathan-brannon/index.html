Voodoo Doughnut Recordings is proud to present our first-ever comedy record, a 7&quot; split-single featuring comedians Ian Karmel and Nathan Brannon riffing irreverently on everything from doughnuts to the War on Terror to Talmudic law. Karmel&#039;s side, titled &quot;(Dilla) jokes&quot; was recorded before a live audience at Little Joy in L.A., where Karmel works as a writer and panelist on the show Chelsea Lately. Nathan Brannon&#039;s side, titled &quot;Doughnut Messaging&quot; was recorded before a live audience at Helium Comedy Club right here in Portland. The record (on limited-edition yellow vinyl!) will be out just in time for the 2014 Bridgetown Comedy Festival, where both Karmel and Brannon will be performing.
