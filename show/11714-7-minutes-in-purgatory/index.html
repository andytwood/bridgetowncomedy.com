7 Minutes in Purgatory challenges comedians to perform directly to a camera alone in a soundproof room, while audience members watch a live feed in another room. This social experiment/comedy show offers a chance to watch performers hilariously and awkwardly attempt to do their act without the benefit of audience feedback. The show, which was described by the Laugh Button as “one of the coolest and most creative additions to the comedy world,” has appeared at festivals like SXSW, Bridgetown, The Onion &amp; AV Club’s 2nd Annual 26th Annual Comedy Fest, High Plains, and the New York Comedy Festival.
