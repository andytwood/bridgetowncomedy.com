Our strong theme is we are a clean comedy show featuring local comics and authors!  We have been selling out shows regularly in SW Portland for 3 years, as the draw for clean comedy is alive and well in Portland!  Our show could offer festival goers something different, as well as provide an opportunity for our regular followers to take in the festival.  We can pack a house!
We have a host, and 5-6 performers, each doing between 5-10 min, with a headliner doing about 15-20 minutes.  The show moves quickly, is well produced and organized, and we&#039;d love to be a part of Bridgetown!
