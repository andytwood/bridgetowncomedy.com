 Arguments and Grievances Comedy Debates pits comedians against each other on such topics as “McRib vs. MacBeth” and “Hugs vs. Drugs”—with audiences deciding the victor.  Each show is recorded and then released as a podcast. It combines joke writing, responding to and roasting your opponent and good old fashioned pandering to create a show where almost anything can happen. The show has been happening in both Denver and Chicago for years and has consistently been one of the most popular comedy shows in both the cities. The format is really simple. Each debate consist of two comedians who get two five minute rounds to make their case on why their topic is better then their opponents and then the crowd decides the victor.
