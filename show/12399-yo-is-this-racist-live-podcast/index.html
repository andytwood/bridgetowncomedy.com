The Yo, Is This Racist? Podcast is a daily podcast offshoot of the blog of the same name, with the very simple premise: Ask me if something is racist, and I&#039;ll tell you. The podcast typically has a writer/comedian guest and me, Andrew Ti, the host, taking a call-in question from a fan, about any and all aspects of racism, or potential racism, in pop culture, politics, the Internet, and sometimes, just from some asshole at work. The tone of the show is as light as the subject matter allows, funny people time to address serious issues in a way that doesn&#039;t need to be preachy or pedantic, and can be fun.

For the live versions of the podcast, I typically have one or two guests, and we take both calls from the voicemail inbox, but also questions from the audience, in a longer form 45min-1hr block. The idea is to create a safe space to ask your dumb questions, to take the sting out of racism and accidentally being racist, and to provide a unique perspective on this burning question.

At Bridgetown, specifically, I&#039;d also be open to the idea of working in stand-up sets, either by having the performers do a quick set, and then calling them back to form the panel that will answer questions.
