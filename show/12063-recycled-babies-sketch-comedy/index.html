I would also love to pitch a Recycled Babies  show for Bridgetown . (possibly a blend of sketch, stand-up, and video pieces, or just members doing stand up interspersed with RB Videos) . 

Some of our members (such as Dwayne Perkins) have performed at Bridgetown before,  and one of our members (Samantha Ketcherside) has very strong roots in the Portland area and would literally pack these shows!   

Below  is a one sheet regarding the group.  Recently we were finalists at Seattle Sketch Fest , shot a promo piece for Paint Care, appeared at Sketchmelt at Meltdown, perform regularly at the Comedy Central Stages,  and are up for our own new media series with football.com (Demos can be sent) 

What I picture for the show could be very simple. 

Intro or Cold Open Sketch

Closing sketch.

This is a similar format the we used for our summer spectacular at the CC stages and it seemed to go over well.  We can simply  do straight stand up and show some of our videos, or  we can  write a show based around bridgetown to give a full through  line for the show.

The Stand up performers who would perform would be Dwayne Perkins , Ian Harris, Michael Magid, and Claude Stuart. (Note instead of members you could fill these slots with festival attendees and just play RB videos in between or  a combo of both. pretty flexible :)     

Thanks for taking the time and look forward to hearing from you! 

Sincerely, Recycled Babies
