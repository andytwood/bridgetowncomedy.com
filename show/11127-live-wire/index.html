Live Wire is radio variety for the attention span challenged. It&#039;s music from up-and-coming bands, original comedy, performance and scintillating interviews with writers, filmmakers, comedians and people who think cool thoughts. Hosted by Luke Burbank (Wait Wait Don&#039;t Tell Me, Too Beautiful to Live), the show is taped in front of a live audience and airs on public radio stations around the country. The Bridgetown edition features Janeane Garofalo, &quot;Fight Club&quot; author Chuck Palahniuk, Jackie Kashian, Dan Harmon, music from Helio Sequence and surprise guests.
