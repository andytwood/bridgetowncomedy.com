Roast Yourself is a monthly show that began in Omaha, NE. It combines a stand up showcase with a roast. Three roasters/writers sit on the stage for the entire show. A comedian will perform a set (approximately 8 minutes, but can be adjusted due to show length or number of performers), and while they perform, the roasters write jokes about the performing comedian and their set. At the end of the set, the comedian takes the notecards the jokes are on and read them to the audience. At the end of the show, the roasters read jokes the performers wrote about them. 
This is a great show for festivals due to the number of comedians that can participate. Mike Perry hosts and writes, and two other comedians join him on the roast panel. Each performer will take a total of 9-10 minutes including their reading of the roast jokes, so in a 90 minute show, you can have 10 comics involved plus Mike as the host. 
The submitted set is from the Crom Comedy Festival and the panel includes Bryan Cook (Competitive Erotic Fan Fiction) and James Adomian (Comedy Bang Bang).
