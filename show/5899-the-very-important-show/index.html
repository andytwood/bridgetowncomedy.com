Here&#039;s the original version at UCB: http://losangeles.ucbtheatre.com/shows/view/3407
It was on Valentine&#039;s Day, but can work outside of the holiday, just make it generally about love.

Love: The Show
All Michael Busch wants to do is finish performing his one man opus -
Love: The Show. Unfortunately, no one else thinks this is a
good idea.

With:
Stephanie Allynne
Kyle Mooney
Johnny Pemberton
Power Violence
Bonafide
David Harris
Gilli Nissim
Marissa Gallant &amp; Joe Stakun
Brian Cooperman, Dan Banas, and Amalia Fite
Lindsey Barrow

Basically, I keep trying to do my pretentious one person show, characters keep interrupting me and I interact with them on stage. 

Again, I think there would be enough people at the festival to do this show.
