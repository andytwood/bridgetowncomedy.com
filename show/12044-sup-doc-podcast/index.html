 At this point and as far as we can tell we are the only comedy/discussion/interview podcast devoted to documentaries. We have a loyal following and have listeners all over the world. We have now recorded 2 LIVE shows and they both went very well. We screen a doc (both have been 30 min docs) and have a panel of 3 interesting people (in this case comedians) to discuss it. Our last LIVE show was recorded in SF Sketchfest 2016 with comedians Emily Heller, Chris Thayer and David Gborie. 

It&#039;s interactive too because we can take questions from the audience. People love documentaries and comedians so it&#039;s a great mix!
