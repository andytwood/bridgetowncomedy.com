Whiskey Tango. Gentlemen… doing gentlemen’s improv. Out of Portland, Oregon, this dapper group of improvisers takes audience suggestions and weaves an elaborate tapestry of scenes, environments, and relationships. With a focus on realism, Whiskey Tango keeps audiences laughing on the edge of their seats. Show is 25-30 minutes in length and features 4-5 performers. Recently accepted into the 2014 SF Sketchfest, Whiskey Tango has performed at the iO West LA Improv Comedy Festival, the Vancouver International Improv Festival, and are six-time winners of Friday Night Fights (Curious Comedy Theater, Portland OR). They are regular performers and instructors at theaters around Portland, and all around great guys. Collectively they are Whiskey Tango. Individually they are Gabe Dinger, Jed Arkley, Leon Anderson, Nathan Loveless, Samuel De Roest (gentleman on sabbatical) and Jake Michels.
