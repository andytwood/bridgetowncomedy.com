Known as &quot;The Onion&quot; for punk rock and hardcore kids, &quot;The Hard Times&quot; has built a substantial online following and is regularly found plastered on your facebook feed, or in links retweeted regularly by Jonah Ray...  Hosted by Hard Times co-founder and head writer Bill Conway A.C.A.B has been bringing a really unique  live show to Kickstand Comedy this year. The shows are well attended and in addition to comedy fans, they consistently bring out an audience that most comedy shows don&#039;t know how to reach. The show format includes character bits, stand ups, sketch, and A/V making a really dynamic DIY show with great energy. Plus you get to hear Jason Traeger telling old school punk stories... its a fantastic show with a great DIY vibe.
