Hey folks! I&#039;d love to feature a Hecklevision screening as part of Bridgetown 2015. I want to go back to the film that started it all for me: HACKERS. (But I&#039;m also open to suggestions!)

Hecklevision is a top secret technology that allows you to use your cellphone to text heckles, jokes and commentary to a special number that displays your comments on screen instantly as the movie plays. My personal tweak on the format is inviting special guests - we feature comedians and have worked with the software developer to add an option to make sure the jokes/comments from our &quot;VIP&quot; guests stand out.

We generally choose movies that are cheesy, bizarre and awful but we still love to watch (and probably saw on cable many many times growing up). Highlights have been films like HACKERS, ROCKY IV, OVER THE TOP, SPACE JAM, etc. We even had a hell of a lot of fun with ROBOCOP, although that one is close to my heart. Generally we get close to 100 attendees.

This would be a great low-pressure show and a really cool opportunity for me to introduce out-of-towners to Hecklevision, which I plan to program for the Alamo Drafthouse when it opens in LA, too. 

NOTE - Photo I uploaded is the old poster, but an example of what I would produce for this one.
