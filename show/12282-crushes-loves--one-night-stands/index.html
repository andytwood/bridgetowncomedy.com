CRUSHES, LOVES, &amp; ONE NIGHT STANDS

This show would be a great edition to the Bridgetown Comedy Festival because the theme is based entirely on what people think about most of the time; dating and relationships and the tragic comedy that occurs when trying to be with another person.  It&#039;s mainly storytelling based but we also allow comics to do their relationship material to mix things up.  And we are starting to have performers illustrate their stories, or provide other visual aids, to have a more multi-media approach.  The show is based on personal confessions so as hosts we take extra special care to make sure that we create a welcoming environment for all backgrounds, performers and audience alike.

CRUSHES, LOVES, &amp; ONE NIGHT STANDS is a different kind of comedy experience that will stick with any audience long after they have left the show and would be a great edition to the Bridgetown Comedy Festival.
