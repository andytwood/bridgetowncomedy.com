Every pro wrestling podcast is either a review &amp; recap show, a news &amp; rumor show or a retro &amp; nostalgia show. They have snarky hosts and bad attitudes. We Watch Wrestling is none of that. We keep it positive and we keep it fun. At it&#039;s heart this is a comedy show. Three friends, all comedians who have performed at Bridgetown individually, discuss what it&#039;s like to be a wrestling fan today. One host is a brand new fan, so an aspect of the show is explaining wrestling to him. We hear from a lot of listeners that don&#039;t watch wrestling, they just love our dynamic, quite a few have even become wrestling fans because of us.
Some listeners are lapsed fans with a reignited interest in the product. And a lot of our subscribers say they&#039;re not embarrassed to tell people they watch pro wrestling anymore because of us. The show is totally spontaneous, we tell stories, do voices, and have a lot of fun. It&#039;s just a very conversational, very funny and very honest, heartfelt show. We have achieved half a million downloads to date, have thousands of followers on Twitter and Facebook and a significant following in the pacific northwest. Please find links included to Issue #69 featuring some of the funniest moments from 2013-2014
(WeWatchWrestling_Issue_69_Best_Of_WWW.mp3) and Issue #104 featuring popular recurring segment &quot;Asking Drive-Thru Clerks Who&#039;s Their Favorite Wrestler&quot; (WeWatchWrestling_Issue_104.mp3)(48min 35sec in), a segment we would very much love to do in Portland, a city with a rich history of pro wrestling and pro wrestling fans. Past guests have included Ron Funches (#116), Dan Soder (#33), and former WWE world champ Dolph Ziggler (#51).
