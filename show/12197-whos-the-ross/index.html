&quot;WHO&#039;S THE ROSS?&quot; is Portland&#039;s longest running late-night talk show, having logged 626 live performances in the past 8 years. 

Imagine Conan with cocktails!

Each show presents a brand-new mixture of comedy, music, and interviews, incorporating elements of improv, sketch, stand-up, and musical comedy. 

WTR&#039;s Bridgetown show(s) will feature performances by comedians from the festival, as well as a top-notch Portland musical guest backed by our very talented jazz-funk house-band, &quot;THEM! THE BAND!&quot; Guests personality, background, and experience will be on full display in sit-down interviews, conducted post performance, also featuring an absurd game or contest, ala Fallon&#039;s &quot;Tonight Show.&quot; 

In addition to the guests from Bridgetown, WTR&#039;s festival performance will be tailor made to the event, exclusively written and constructed for this engagement.
