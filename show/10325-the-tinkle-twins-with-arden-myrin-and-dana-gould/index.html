The Tinkle Twins stars Dana Gould (The Simpsons, Mob City) and Arden Myrin (Chelsea Lately, Orange Is the New Black) as douchey identical twins. It is a monthly show at Nerdmelt Showroom at Meltdown Comics in Los Angeles. The Tinkle Twins have no idea that the fact that they are a man and a woman, are different ages and have different parents would make it impossible for them to be exact replicas of one another. The Twins host a jacked-up fake kids show with stand up guests, characters and music. The twins set the joyful creepy mood for the first 30 minutes of the show.
