“Computer Show&quot; is a technology talk show set in 1983 but with real tech-entrepreneur guests from the present day.  Computer Show hit the Internet by storm this fall and only had their first “LIVE&quot; performance at the SF Sketch Fest a month ago. Computer Show is the brainchild of Sandwich Video’s Adam Lisagor and Roxana and Tony Altamirano. Gary Fabert (The host) is played by Rob Baedeker of legendary SF sketch group Kasper Hauser.  It&#039;s as simple as this: The show and its hosts are from 1983, and the guests (real tech entrepreneurs) are from the present.
