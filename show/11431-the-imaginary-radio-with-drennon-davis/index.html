The Imaginary Radio Program in some form has come to Bridgetown before, so you should have some idea of what to expect.  The current version of the show is now a monthly show that runs the first Sunday of every month at The Satellite in Los Angeles.  The full show includes Drennon Davis, and a slate of guest comedians and musicians, putting on an 90-120 minutes of sketch/music/improv as Drennon guides the audience through a series of &quot;stations&quot; each landing on a new song, spoken word parody or commercial parody. 

Drennon works with each booked guest to come up with a specific item for the show. Whether that&#039;s a pre-existing bit that they can plug into, and improvised song off a particular theme, a series of call in jokes (utilizing the other show guests as callers), or something wholly original that the guest would like to do themselves. 

It&#039;s an opportunity for comedians and musicians alike to do something funny outside of stand up.  Past examples of these include: James Adomian reading &quot;Twas The Night Before Christmas&quot; in character as Jesse Ventura; Seane Keane doing a This American Life parody as Ira Glass talking about the plot of American Pie; Rachel Bloom performing her songs with backing from Drennon; Eliza Skinner on a call in show improvising songs based on caller suggestions; music mashups of two disparate artists such as Genuweinfeld (Genuwine and Seinfeld) or Jim Morrissey (Jim Morrison and Morrissey).

There are regular acts in most shows (Nick Stargu, Karen Kilgariff, Sean Keane) that Drennon often uses as well as numerous artists who have done it before either in Los Angeles or its many tour locations. There&#039;s no show like it anywhere.
