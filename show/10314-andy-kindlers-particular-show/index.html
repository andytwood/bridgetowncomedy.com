Andy chooses from his rolodex (Rolex?) of comedy superstars from LA and around the world (New York) to present a hilarious (his words) and very Particular show. Andy’s the host. It’s his party and he will do time in between each comic if he wants to.
 
Andy Kindler is a frequent guest on The Late Show with David Letterman.  He currently recurs on IFC’s Maron, Comedy Central’s Tosh.O and is Mort the Mortician on Fox’s hit animation show Bob’s Burgers.
