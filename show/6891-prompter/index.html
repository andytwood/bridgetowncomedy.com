A new show from Troy Conrad (Creator of Set List: Stand-Up Without A Net)  Comics use a teleprompter to deliver a demented, bad-idea TED Talk-style presentation.  When the teleprompter unexpectedly goes blank throughout the talk, the performer must rely on their ability to improvise and continue their talk on the subject until the prompter comes back on. A sold-out hit at this years SF Sketchfest, the show will also be featured at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in August. How much fun can comics have with a supposedly &quot;broken&quot; teleprompter? A lot, it turns out.
