From Paul Provenza and Troy Conrad…  Set List: Stand-Up Without A Net is currently a 14-episode TV series on Sky Atlantic in the UK starring Robin Williams, Maria Bamford, Gilbert Gottfried, Greg Proops, Fred Willard, Drew Carey, and more.  Comics are given outrageous, never-before-seen topics on a in the moment, and perform seamlessly as if its the act they normally do, while the audience follows the absurd, original topics on a projection screen.
This international sensation returns to Bridgetown from sold-out shows at festivals in Edinburgh, Melbourne, SXSW, Montreal, Toronto, Austria, London, and beyond. Set List runs monthly at UCB and Nerdmelt in Los Angeles.  The show is also currently a 60-episode web series on the Nerdist Channel with a new episode every Friday.
