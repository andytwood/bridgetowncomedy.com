The Nickel Club is a theme show in LA that promises audience members an immersive night of comedy, jazz, and fun. Each show starts with the audience being ushered into the world of &quot;The Nickel Club&quot;, the world&#039;s premiere secret society. Like a 1920s speakeasy, as the audience arrives, they give the password to &#039;the bouncer&#039; (played by a comic), they are led into the secret venue by lantern (venue dependent) where they will find the producers in character and dressed to the 9&#039;s as a live jazz band plays classic tunes. To begin the show, the hosts &quot;initiate&quot; the audience into the Nickel Club, a society that has been around as long as time. Then, the comedy show starts, which is their reward for being part of this exclusive secret society. The comics then do sets where they can play along with the jazz band. Some ask them to punctuate jokes, others ask them to do nothing, others still have the band play sweet melodies behind a story or a joke.  After the show, time permitting, the band plays and people enjoy the rest of their night.
