Lighthearted, sex-positive and curiosity driven, I am always amazed at how brilliantly the podcast gives comedian ample material for laughs. Previously co-hosted with Dave Ross,  I explore a topic a week. While comedy leaning myself, I love playing an awkward straight man with naive questions to the many comedians who come on the show. 

Fresh from 2 wonderfully successful shows at SF Sketchfest, one on multiple orgasms and the other on friends with benefits, I&#039;m hoping to do something that even further highlights comedians. I&#039;ve been wanting to do a show on urban dictionary terms (slightly @midnigh-like) or interview a Portland sex club manager with the help of a few comics. 

I just think it would be silly fun. Plus last time I was there we sold out Dante&#039;s, so I know I have an audience at Bridgetown. Thanks for considering!
