Hosted by Doug Smith and Matt Wayne, SEE YOU IN HELL challenges comics to perform their best sets while going through hell (i.e. &quot;OVER THE TOP HELL&quot; arm-wrestling an audience member, &quot;WHISKEY DRINKING BEAR HELL drinking whiskey while wearing a bear suit, CHIPPENDALE HELL, dancing as a Chippendale stripper, GUATANAMO BAY HELL, doing a set while blind-folded, hands tied and at gun point, etc).
 
Matt and Doug do about 10 minutes up top with (usually) a prepared bit and explanation of the show. They then invite the first comic up and have them pick the hell out of a hat/bowl. Each comic follows and goes through the same lottery. The show is a lot of fun and has gotten great feedback from comics and audiences. Response is always about how wild and different it is than any other show they&#039;ve seen. Doug and Matt did the show for Comedy Central in LA last year, and it was included in Comedy Bureau’s list of “The 100 Best Things in Comedy We Were Witness To” in 2014.
