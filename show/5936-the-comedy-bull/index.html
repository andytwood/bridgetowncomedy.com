Competitive Stand Up with elements of improvisation 

Each competitor gets 4 minutes to perform comedy set and being judged by a panel of 3 judges chosen by the producer of the show.

After 4 minute mark judges may (depending on quality /intensity of the set) allow the performer to continue longer or be stopped  and challenged  to perform one of the following improvisational tasks

1.Crowd work - comedian asked to interact with the audience.

2.Rant on the subject - subject is chosen by the judges from one of the suggestions given by  the audience (performer expected to come up with a funny rant on that subject).

3.&quot;Corrida&quot;- AKA improvisational game of NEW CHOICE - each time the judges ring a bell   - previously said sentence has to be rephrased with the different choice of words 

4. Interpret an image - performer is required to comment /interpret on the random image  projected on screen at that time.

During those tasks the performers are challenged to hold the interest/engagement of the audience for as long as possible 
Performer which holds stage the longest ( time of the set before the interruption by the judges + time of the challenge before the interruption by the judges) wins competition and determined to be the funniest performer of the night. 

Three (3) strongest performers move to next round.
