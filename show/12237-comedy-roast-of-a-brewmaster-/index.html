Hey Bridgetown! Our show is a Comedy Roast, we run it monthly here in the Bay Area (SF and Berkeley) and each time feature a different archetype as a guest of honor.  Then we find an actual professional from that field, write some hilarious jokes for them and have a good old fashion, no jokes barred, comedy roast! 

This show is super fun, it&#039;s been going on for the last three years and we were just in SF Sketchfest!  We&#039;ve roasted everything from a Lawyer, Pothead and Street Kid to a Stripper, Drag Queen and Professional Wrestler.

We would love to come up with 4 of our best roasters and then add to that line-up with some locals.  As far as the guest of honor, we thought a Brewmaster would be a good topic for Portland, but are also flexible on that.  We can handle getting the guest of honor confirmed and set-up once there is a date.

Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to hearing back from you.

Best,
-Pete
