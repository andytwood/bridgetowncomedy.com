Kurt Braunohler&#039;s brand of comedy could be described as &quot;high-energy absurdity from an approachable stranger&quot; but he prefers to describe his brand as &quot;Doritos&quot;.

Kurt was named a &quot;Comic To Watch&quot; by Variety, Time Out NY, Time Out LA, Comedy Central, and the NY Comedy Festival.  On TV, Kurt has been seen on CONAN, The Tonight Show, Delocated, Comedy Central Presents, BUNK, John Oliver Presents, @Midnight, Chelsea Lately, Bob&#039;s Burgers, New Girl, Drunk History, Getting Doug with High, Adam Devine&#039;s House Party and more.

Kurt rode a jet ski from Chicago to New Orleans on a seven city water tour/ charity mission to send 500 goats and 1,000 chickens to families in need in Africa. The adventure was filmed by Comedy Central and Kurt&#039;s nine episode &quot;Roustabout&quot; webseries is now availble on cc.com.   

His debut comedy album How Do I Land? made AV Club, Paste Magazine, Village Voice, and Time Out New York&#039;s  Best Of lists.   His popular podcast &quot;The K Ohle&quot; airs weekly on the Nerdist Network.
