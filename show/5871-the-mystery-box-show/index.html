The Mystery Box Show (http://www.mysteryboxshow.com) is a live storytelling series based in Portland, OR that focuses on stories of sex and sexuality. Following the traditions of live storytelling set by shows like The Moth and Kevin Allison&#039;s RISK!, The Mystery Box Show features real people sharing true personal stories about the many ways that sex influences our lives. 

Storytellers at The Mystery Box Show have included bestselling authors, nationally touring comedians, an editor from Playboy TV, a sex toy expert, members from the kink community, students, and professionals from all walks of life. With a primary focus on entertainment, it&#039;s often surprising how touching and heartfelt these stories can be while other stories may inspire listeners to chase after recently-awakened desires.

Performing since April of 2012, The Mystery Box Show has appeared regularly in Portland, OR as a bi-monthly show and putting in special appearances at events such as Wordstock and OMSI After Dark, as well traveling to the 2013 Arse Elektronika festival in San Francisco.
