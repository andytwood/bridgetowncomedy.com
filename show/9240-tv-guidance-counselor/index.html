This show is a ton of fun and fairly unique. It&#039;s not snarky at all. We show a real reverence for the shows of our youth and peel back life experiences to discuss living situations and the shared experience of classic television. It&#039;s a fun conversation and a nice change from stand up.

Unlike other Stand up comedian fronted podcasts, this one doesn&#039;t focus too much on the mechanics of comedy. Although I&#039;ve only been doing the show a year, we&#039;re getting about 10k downloads a month all over the world. I&#039;ve also had some experience with doing live editions as we&#039;ve done them now at New York Super Week/New York ComicCon (with Amy Sedaris), North East Comic Con (with Evan Michaelson from Oddieis/Obscura Antiques), The Boston Comedy Festival (with Emmanuel Lewis of Webster) and will have done one at Riot LA in January (guest TBA, I know who it is, but don&#039;t want to jinx it, nice big name).

I have a unique knowledge of television and revisiting a specific week of our lives always leads to some fun tangents and interesting insights from my guests.

I own every issue of TV Guide, and review them frequently. It&#039;s a life long passion and it&#039;s interesting to see how people form all different backgrounds share an early love of television.
