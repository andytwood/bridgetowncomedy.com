Hike Mic is an open mic hosted by Jason Van Glass and Rob Schultz. Over the last four years, we&#039;ve set up shop at more than a dozen scenic outdoor locations around Los Angeles including the Hollywood Sign, La Brea Tar Pits, and abandoned Los Feliz Zoo. We think this format has limitless appeal in Portland, and would like to bring it to the festival as a mid-afternoon (3PM-5PM) activity, both as a fun additional performance opportunity to all festival performers, and as a social gathering for comedians and comedy fans alike. We are not experts on Portland&#039;s best open spaces that double as photo opportunities, but suspect that the Eastbank Esplanade, Mills End Park, and Belmont Goat Field would be promising locations for a combination adventurous-outing/comedy show.
