Festival the Show is an hour to an hour and a half long show that aims to shed light on the hilarities and hypocrisies of festival culture. The show was written in sketch format but has strong story arch and character development. With &quot;tweeners&quot; between every act, the show is captivating from beginning to end. Although it is aimed at addressing festival culture, there are many jokes that are analogous to everyday life. With live music, original song and dance numbers, circus acts, elaborate costuming and larger than life props, there is truly something for everyone.
