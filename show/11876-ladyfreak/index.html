Performing to sold-out crowds at UCB, LADY/FREAK is the brainchild of best friends &amp; comedians Grace Parra (The Nightly Show w/Larry Wilmore, FUSE) and Jen Bartels (Friends of the People, TruTV), who come together to explore the age-old adage of being both “a LADY in the streets and a FREAK in the sheets.” This all-female sex-positive comedy talk show is an hour-long PANEL format that combines a real sex expert, celebrity guests, stand-up comedians, and the hilarity &amp; honesty of putting it all out on the table. NOTHING is off limits. Produced by Liz Bohnsack (Conan, 2016 Summer Olympics), LADY/FREAK chooses one specific topic every show to delve into (past topics include SEX &amp; TECHNOLOGY, PORNOGRAPHY &amp; WOMEN, BAD SEX, INTERRACIAL DATING, etc), and Grace &amp; Jen use personal anecdotes, songs, rapid round Q&amp;A’s and interactive media to engage their panel and titillate their audiences. Past guests include Maria Bamford (Netflix), Mary Lynn Rajskub (24), Amanda Crew (Silicon Valley), Stefanie Beatriz (Brooklyn 99), Aya Cash &amp; Kether Donahue (You’re The Worst) and many, many more.
 
Our vision for doing LADY/FREAK specifically at Bridgetown is this: We would like to choose a panel of 3-4 female comedians from the line-up of ladies who are performing at Bridgetown, to give them another opportunity to perform and for audiences to see them in a new light. We’ll also bring in a female sexpert who is local to Portland to provide the expert POV. We think this is a really cool way to showcase the female comedians of Bridgetown through another prism, and we are fans of the festival and would absolutely love the chance to perform with you guys. Thanks for considering us!
