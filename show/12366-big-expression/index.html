We get the audience to drop some hard truths; That&#039;s just one thing you can definitely expect from a B)i(G EXPRESSION show. Some hard truths may include having a sex dream about your lonely mom, calling your dad fat when you&#039;re eight years old, or sleeping around with three people in one day. Using spotlights and full washes instead of blackouts, the duo has changed the traditional form of a normal sketch show to create a seamless comedy experience that&#039;s more like an acid trip. With the help of live tribal drummers, vignettes of human behavior are shown through campfire storytelling. The show features original songs, videos, and encourages audience participation.
Our audience members have described our shows as &quot;The Burning Man of Comedy.&quot;
