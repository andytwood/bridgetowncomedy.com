Secrets, Lies &amp; Alibis is a one-of-a-kind variety showcase inspired by anonymous audience secrets. Every month our fans spill their guts and we create new sketches and games based on their confessions. Additionally, we have Chicago&#039;s best stand-up, characters and comedy music throughout the show. We typically run about 70-90 minutes.

For a festival show, we would make some adjustments to be accommodating. All the variety spots could be for stand-ups and we could fit anywhere from 4-7 stand ups (depending on timing) into the show. We would also ideally get secrets from that nights audience to use in the games and perform a couple of our &quot;best of&quot; sketches. 

This show is so much fun because it&#039;s audience interactive. People love to see their secrets come to life and participate in the games. It&#039;s a high-energy, unique concept that has gotten rave reviews. We&#039;ve been a recommended pick by the Chicago Reader and featured in the Red Eye multiple times. As one of the fastest growing monthly shows in Chicago, we have an ever-expanding, loyal audience. 

Secrets, Lies &amp; Alibis is produced, written and performed by Sarah Albritton, Amanda Lynn Deal, Elliot Lerner and Alex Seligsohn. Mostly women-produced, 1/2 Jewish, 100% weird and fun! The producers have performed in festivals and clubs throughout the country including Arch City Comedy Festival, Cleveland Comedy Festival, Funny Women&#039;s Fest LA, Chicago Nerd Comedy Festival, Zanies Comedy Clubs, The Improv and Kill Tony Podcast. 

We&#039;ve had some fantastic guest performers including Sean White, Chris Redd, Emily Galati, Martin Morrow, Marty DeRosa, Jacob Williams, Sonia Denis, Felonius Munk, Dave Helem and Jay Washington, among others.
