Our FM Radio show/podcast has a very specific format.  It takes a date gone bad and deconstructs it from both the participants&#039; perspectives.  The man and woman (or frequently same-sex couples) both explain their ideas about what went wrong during an early dating experience.  The versions are rarely the same and the reasons for the lack of attraction are always enlightening to one or the other or BOTH  of the daters. For the past two years we have entertained the public while educated countless daters on their foibles and also their strengths in dating.  Our live version has the audience participating in the questioning and discussion with both parties from the date.
