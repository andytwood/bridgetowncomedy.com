Fresh Fish is a variety show I host at UCB LA with its own unique voice and feel to it. Ask any comic who&#039;s performed and they will tell you it&#039;s a fun, weird, one of a kind show. From the time the audience enters the theatre we engage them in some way - for example, having performers in character usher them in as tour guides, pointing out historic events that happened in and around the theatre. To open the show I have the audience stand up to sing the national anthem. Which is &#039;All-Star&#039; by Smash Mouth. I also have a house band called The All Band Leaders Band - they were all so great, I made each of them the band leader. So between acts they each play whatever song they want, and when I ask the band leader a question they all answer at once. I doubt the regular musicians would make the trip, but there&#039;s no rehearsal involved so I&#039;m sure I could get a group together from Portland. My goal is to present a show that surprises and engages the audience throughout, and is also a positive fun experience. I book a mix of stand ups, sketch groups, characters, musical acts, and weird/variety acts such as magicians, sword jugglers, dance troupes, and stilt walkers. I book a mix of well-known acts (Jerry Minor, Nicole Byer, Trevor Moore, Brody Stevens) and great lesser known ones. In addition there are a few regular performers on the show such as Natalie Palamides (Powerpuff Girls) who would hopefully make the trip.

So the video linked below isn&#039;t best quality, but hopefully can give you an idea.
