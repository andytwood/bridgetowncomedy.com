At the end of 2014, after a few years of mismanaging my Type I diabetes and abusing drugs and alcohol, I lapsed into a diabetic coma that lasted almost a month. After three weeks, my family came within a legal technicality of taking me off of life support. My friends and the comedy community in Chicago presumed I was dead and posted their eulogies of me on Facebook. Then I woke up. &quot;Dave Maher Coma Show&quot; is the story of that experience and its aftermath. The format of the show is about 50% storytelling, 40% stand-up and 10% theater. I tell the story chronologically but with a stand-up approach that keeps it from being maudlin or overly sentimental. There are several bits that break up the pace of a more traditional storytelling or stand-up show, like an awards segment in which I share the &quot;Best Eulogy&quot; and &quot;Worst Eulogy&quot; (among other categories I share like &quot;Most Awkward Interaction With an Acquaintance&quot;) and an intentionally rigged Q&amp;A game segment near the very end of the show that I call &quot;Better Questions.&quot; It&#039;s a fun, revealing, honest and hopefully enlightening show on a heavy topic unlike any other show I know.
