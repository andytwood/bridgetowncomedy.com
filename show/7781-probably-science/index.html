Three professional comedians and incompetent scientists take you through the week in science. Incompetently. Featuring Matt Kirshen (Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, Nerdist, Last Comic Standing), Andy Wood (Bridgetown Comedy Festival, LA Podcast Festival), Jesse Case (Just For Laughs, Live At Gotham, Last Comic Standing), and, until a few months ago when he met Lorne Michaels, co-host Brooks Wheelan (Saturday Night Live), with special guests from the world of science and comedy.

Past guests have included Chris Hardwick, Karen Gillan, Rhys Darby, Peter Serafinowicz, Gallagher (sorry about that one), The Sklar Brothers, TJ Miller, and scientists Dr. Sean Carroll and Dr. Janna Levin.

Itâ€™s the most topical, up-to-date, half-assed science, delivered straight to you in bite-sized comedy chunks.
