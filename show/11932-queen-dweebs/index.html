We wrote this show to throw a party for our fellow nerds and queens. Knowing that everyone’s got a little queen and geek in them, we touch on a range of topics from Russian lit, Batman vs. Superman, proper bloody Mary recipes, podcast voices, Greek mythology and much much more.  It’s interactive. There’s music and dancing. It’s the best type of comedy freak show out there!
