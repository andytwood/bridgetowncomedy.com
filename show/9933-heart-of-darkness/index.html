Hi . 

  I&#039;ve been thinking about doing my show Heart of Darkness at Bridgetown for a few months now.  I think it would be a very perfect fit. 

Each show has a guest speaker we call a &#039;Mind Warrior&#039;, 2-3 comedians and a musical guest. In the past we&#039;ve had Mind Warriors  Graham Hancock,  Heather Berlin Ph.D, Dennis Mckenna ,  Andrew W.K., Daniel Pinchbeck and many more, as well as comedians Janeane Garofalo, Jim Gaffigan and Reggie Watts, Chelsea Peretti, Fred Armisen, Jim Gaffigan, Michael Showalter among many others.   The show is a themed variety show featuring 3 comics, a scientist and a musical guest with a house band and me hosting. The audience is also very involved: we bring an audience member on stage to sit in the &#039;I love you chair&#039; and at the end of the show we forgive everyone for their sins getting as many as we can by going into the audience.  I&#039;ll book comics that will already be coming to Bridgetown and contact a few local bands. I&#039;ve performed in Portland a decent amount of times and know musicians and am confident it would be easy to pull off. 

The show is a way for artists and audience members to participate and collaborate in ideas and experience something that will only happen once.  

I just did one at the Brooklyn Museum and will be in LA this Feb to do the Cinefamily and then the Hollywood Improv in March.  

I would really love to do as many as I could in Bridgetown.  it would be most most excellent.  

love,
Greg
