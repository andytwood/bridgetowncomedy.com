My Diary is a show I&#039;ve been doing for a year at UCB, The Improv and Comedy Central Stages. It&#039;s just got an extended run at UCB and will be featured on Bravo&#039;s &quot;Vanderpump Rules&quot;.
It&#039;s a very special and unique show where comedians, writers and actors share diary entries from their past. But it&#039;s so much more... The performers are given free reign to recount from their entries as they see fit. We have had power point presentations, songs, dances, re-enactments, Face Times, raps, conference calls and traditional reading. It&#039;s a very special and unique show because audiences are given a chance to see a completely different side of comedians they know and love. While it&#039;s always very funny, it also has a very real and very vulnerable aspect to it which is completely compelling for audiences.  This show is full of surprises and a lot of fun. 
Past guests include:  Matt Braunger, Alice wetterlund, Eric Andre, Jonathan Ames (creator of bored to death/Blunt talk/ the moth) Brent Weinbach, Nick Thune, Beth Stelling, Kate Berlant, Greg Barris, Jonah Ray, Erin McGathy, Kate Freund, Curt Neil, Eric Dadourian, Timm Sharp, Mary Holland,  Milana Vayntraub, Courtney Paruso, Whitmer Thomas, Nicole Byer, John Ennis, Anna Seregina, Eliza Skinner,
