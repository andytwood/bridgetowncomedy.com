Twice a month, Chicago comedian Cody Melcher invites funny friends over to talk about a really really weird book he just made them read. Past guests include @midnight&#039;s Dan Telfer, Nostalgia Critic&#039;s Tamara-Lynn Chambers, Last Comic Standing&#039;s Amy Sumpter, MaxFun&#039;s Lady to Lady ladies, Defining Marriage&#039;s Matt Baume, University of Texas Rhetoric Professor Trish Roberts-Miller, and Community’s Danny Pudi. Past books have ranged from alien conspiracy books, to a 1950s pickup artist book, to ‘Twilight’, and everything in between. We love to delve into weird, obscure, terrifying, terrible, and just plain evil books and look at the absurdity of it and the kinds of culture they represent.

Tomefoolery was named one of Queerty.com&#039;s &quot;10 Things We&#039;re Thankful For This Thanksgiving&quot; in 2014 and was recently mentioned in Seattle&#039;s alternative newspaper, The Stranger.

We average around 3,000 downloads a month, and upcoming guests this year include Jackson Bird (&quot;Will it Waffle?” on Youtube, The Harry Potter Alliance.com), Mara Wilson (Matilda, Cracked.com), Guy Branum (Totally Biased with W. Kamau Bell, The Mindy Project), and Daniel Kibblesmith (The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, ClickHole.com).
