A Sketch Comedy Show with real Magic and a Puppet!  

SISTERS FROM OTHER MISTERS (Nicole Nasca &amp; Amanda Talbot) is a two-woman show that uniquely blends sketch comedy, classically trained magic, and not-so-classically trained ventriloquism.  Think Absolutely Fabulous meets David Copperfield meets Jeff Dunham’s worst nightmare.

The Balls Sisters, two senior sisters in their twilight years, retell their life&#039;s story in an interview backstage during America’s Got Talent.  Pearl Balls (Amanda Talbot - Second City, Magic Castle Hollywood) is a British magician who never knew her father and is her mum Molly Balls’s favorite daughter.  Kitty Kitty Balls (Nicole Nasca - Second City, UCB) is an American ventriloquist who never knew her different father and is Molly Balls’s least favorite daughter.  The Balls sisters grew up with just each other after being both abandoned by Molly Balls, only to have their bond shattered over a mistaken love triangle between Pearl Balls and Phil (Kitty Kitty’s saucy puppet).  We see the sister’s journey and struggle to reconcile with each other and make it big in show business through a series of sketches from their Vaudevillian roots to today’s TV reality shows.

SISTERS FROM OTHER MISTERS is written and performed by Nicole Nasca &amp; Amanda Talbot and premiered on the Second City Hollywood main stage and is an official selection of Cake Batter’s Funny Women Festival Los Angeles.
