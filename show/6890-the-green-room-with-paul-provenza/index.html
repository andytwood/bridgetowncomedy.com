Comedian and director of the obscenely hilarious hit film The Aristocrats, Paul Provenza invites some of the biggest names in stand-up to sit down and try to beat each other to the punch line. From politics and racism to sex and money, no topic is off limits in The Green Room. Roseanne Barr, Sandra Bernhard, Drew Carey, Andy Dick, Eddie Izzard, Penn Jillette and Bob Saget are just a few of Provenza&#039;s friends who have appeared in The Green Room to show what really goes on when comedians go off.
