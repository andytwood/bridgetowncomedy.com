A live taping of the K Ohle&#039;s GET LOST format. The entire audience will be blindfolded, put on a bus and driven somewhere fantastic they&#039;ve never been. During the bus ride they&#039;ll be entertained by Kurt and a special guest comedian taunting them the whole way. Once at this VERY SECRET LOCATION, they will be un-blindfolded and allowed to explore on their own, while Kurt explains where they are, and why they&#039;re there. The entire insane experience should take about 3 hours. Prepare for walking, and possible encounters with dirt and awe.
