The K Ohle is a multi-format podcast hosted by comedian Kurt Braunohler. FORMATS INCLUDE (but are not limited to): The Boat Show – &quot;The Best Non-Boating Boat Show on the Internet&quot; -- Kurt and his guests talk at length about boating, a topic of which they have no knowledge. PETophilia – “The Animal Show for People Who Think Animals are Dumb” – guests get into it about their pets; plus, Animal Stories of the Week, Fact Animal Facts, and Who’s Dumber, the fun game the humiliates animals! Get Lost! – “This Feels a Bit Rape-y” - Every episode, Kurt takes a guest into his car, blindfolds them, drives them somewhere they’ve never been, and they have to figure out where they are and how they’d get back. And they have some chats along the way. FactTime - Kurt and co-host Matt Oberg unpack and investigate improvised stories from comedians while applying faulty scientific theories in a very produced and tightly edited format. If you love Radiolab, you&#039;ll love FactTime.
