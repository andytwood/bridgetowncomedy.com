CATHARSIS:Comics Ever Mainard, Aaron Weaver and Lindsay Adams Host CATHARSIS. Catharsis is a show that challenges comedians to reveal something they hide and release their inhibitions to the room. Audience members are encouraged to drop an anonymous confession into the &quot;purge bucket&quot; and free themselves of their judgements. It&#039;s a fun &amp; humorous &quot;safe space&quot; with a unique experience every show.
