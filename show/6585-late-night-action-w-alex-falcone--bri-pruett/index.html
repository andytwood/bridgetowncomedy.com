Late Night Action is a live talk show in the style of Conan if he did his show in a Portland garage. It features a topical monologue, celebrity guests, comedians, and local bands, all focused on the Portland area. LNA is hosted by the quick and funny Alex Falcone (Portlandia, Live Wire! Radio, Portland Mercury) and wise-crackin&#039; side kick Bri Pruett (Willamette Week&#039;s Funniest 5) and directed by Caitlin Kunkel (Second City).
