Funny Over Everything is a comedy show that was the highest attended of the 2015 festival according to Sean Jordan so maybe that&#039;s true who knows. It was packed though. It features Portland home champs Ian Karmel, Sean Jordan, Shane Torres, and Phil Schallberger and away champs to be determined by the folks running the show. The show is largely geared toward promoting comics who have the material but not necessarily the name recognition that would make them a known quantity.
