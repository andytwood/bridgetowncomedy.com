This is the monthly cabaret show I run in Oakland, CA. Each month revolves around a theme, and I choose jokes and songs to perform based on that theme. So, for example, a theme of &quot;Marriage/Weddings&quot; featured jokes about my own wedding, weddings I have attended, how to hate-tweet a wedding without getting caught, and marriage in general, plus performances of the songs White Wedding (Billy Idol), Hotel Yorba (The White Stripes), and I Believe in Love (Hair).

In addition, I perform several segments that tie into a slideshow I build (like a TED talk, but not at all educational). These are typically topical jokes or they tie into the theme.
-4 Minute Movie: An entire movie condensed into 4 minutes of dialogue, all performed by me. Previous features include Valley of the Dolls, Requiem for a Dream, and A League of Their Own.
-Manifesto Destiny: I practice for my two dream careers, humorously naming nail polish colors and writing misleading movie descriptions for cable channel guides.
-Fame Swap: I&#039;m tired of not being famous, so I choose a celebrity I believe I could easily replace.

With each guest comedian, I offer a chance to participate in a &quot;Dream Interview.&quot; They reveal who they would most like to be interviewed by, and then I help them rehearse the questions they&#039;d like to be asked.

As a monthly show, I feature one comic, but for festivals, I feature 4 comics doing 10 minute sets, plus 5 minute interviews. The theme will likely be one we&#039;ve done before, and comics will be encouraged to tailor their sets to fit in with the theme. I also have an accompanist, Michelle Alexander, who plays piano and the source of witty, Paul Schaefer-esque banter. 

Thanks so much for considering me--I would love to bring this show to Portland.
