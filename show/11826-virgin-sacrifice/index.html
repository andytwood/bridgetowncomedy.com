Virgin Sacrifice
A night of Stand-Up Comedy
Comedians sacrifice one Stand-Up Virgin!
You never forget your first set!

Lights up. Nicole Blaine, host and creator, explains to the audience what they are about to see. First up, top comedians from late night TV and Comedy Central will perform. Then, after 70 minutes of watching the pros make it look easy, one person, who has never done stand-up before and was never planning on doing it in their lifetime, will perform for the first (and most likely last) time in their life. On stage. Alone. While you watch. Virgin Sacrifice! You never forget your first set!

Nicole gives the audience background information on our Virgin. This is a person who has a “normal” career. Previous Virgins have been doctors, lawyers, bankers, bartenders, and grandfathers. They are booked months ahead of time, and Nicole helps them prepare for their big night. They invite everyone they know. Every show has sold out for over two years. No one wants to miss Anne from accounting’s once in-a-lifetime attempt to be funny. 

The Virgin sits in the audience during the show. After the professional comics perform, Nicole interviews them about their first time doing stand up. They tell the audience their first joke or other memorable “firsts.” They offer the Virgin advice before their big moment. 

The Virgin headliner finally takes the stage. The entire room is on the edge of their seats. The Virgin is visibly shaking. The first joke lands. Laughter. Success. Adrenaline for all. It’s a night to remember. Forever.

Former Virgin Ted Nicholson sums it up best: “That was the best night of my adult life. After being a Virgin, I decided to go back to work on the music career I abandoned ten years ago. Virgin Sacrifice changed my life.”

*On an important side note, Bridgetown has a special place in my heart. Portland has been the hometown of my little brother for the last 10 years. He is what every little brother encompasses; your best friend and biggest enemy. He’s the only person who understands how crazy our parents are and has always been my rock when getting through tough family times. He is a psychotherapist who has never performed on a stage in his lifetime. He was a nerdy, introverted smelly kid with only 3 friends growing up. He blossomed into a successful, strong yuccie. Who happens to think he is funnier than me. There is nothing I want more than to take my brother’s virginity. On stage. In front of all his friends. Well, you know what I mean…. 

I think the Brother Bridgetown Virgin Sacrifice would be my best sacrifice yet. It would be an honor to be a part of the festival and sacrifice a few local Portlanders. It’s a huge dream for me to be included in something so great and respected in the comedy community. I truly appreciate your consideration. 

Thank you.
