Open Mike Eagle is an L.A. based hip-hop artist. On Secret Skin, he and his guests examine whatâ€™s really going on behind the face that comics and hip-hop artists put on for the public. The in-jokes. The heavy stuff. The tour stories. The day-to-day struggles and absurdities of being a working musician. The Secret Skin.

Developing from the Mike Eagle variety shows that took place in LA, Seattle, San Francisco, New York, and Atlanta, Mike Eagle&#039;s Secret Skin Live combines the comedy and rap performances of his live show with a quick-fire interview format that allows each performer to illuminate their story in a way that their peformance might not allow. Interviews are edited together to create special live episodes of the Secret Skin podcast

past stand up guests: Hannibal Buress, James Adomian, Cameron Esposito, Chris Gethard, Baron Vaughn, Greer Barnes and many more
