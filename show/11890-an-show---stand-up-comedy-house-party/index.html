AN SHO(w) is hard to describe but a joy to create and incredible onstage. We&#039;re four roommates in our mid-20s who started this in our house, crafting incredible lineups and then daring each other to do our sets with absurd obstacles (examples include having to repeat sentences whenever a bell rang, performing outside on a 100ft mic cable while the audience and PA stayed in, selfie-sticking entire sets, performing in trees, telling jokes with a Nerf gun sniper in the attic and a second shooter hidden in the kitchen, headlining sets with pianos we can&#039;t play and having to perform onstage while your ashamed self from ten years later visits via satellite to dismissively heckle your current batch of jokes) with the aim of forcing each other to step up their game and keep their cool while surrounded by their favorite comedians. 

Since our move to UCB Sunset, first monthly, and now on 1st and 3rd Mondays, we&#039;ve had free rein to make something immensely goofy. We&#039;ve had Bigfoot sightings after making the entire audience turn off their phones, elaborate, saxophone-driven, Starbucks-inspired striptease numbers, improv games where comics had to create backstories for shelter cats minute-by-minute, live dating games and full dinner dates taking place during the show, we&#039;ve done the show as a talk show, a game show, a sporting event, a live audience audition and table read for a gritty new take on Archie&#039;s Pal Jughead,  a TED Talk, and are currently working on our first live bottle episode, where we get locked in the elevator, reminisce about the time we were locked in the freezer, and flashback to favorite moments, feature some favorite performers from the past and dreams of ones we could never have, and even get a set from Heaven after one of us freezes to death. It&#039;s cooperative, collaborative, optimistic, messy and fun always. We&#039;re having the time of our lives here, and try to keep up with our motto of Every Single Thing is the Most Important Thing Ever Especially This Right Now.

Our antics are silly, over-the-top crowd-pleasers and we&#039;re great hosts and have had some outstanding guests. We&#039;d love to make our first trip to Portland as a quartet and take our SHO(w) to its first festival. We&#039;ve had some unforgettable SHO(w)s in Los Angeles - we&#039;ve had Patton Oswalt open and Reggie Watts close, and Maria Bamford open and Reggie Watts close, and honestly, we&#039;ve had Reggie on the SHO(w) so many times that everybody knows he&#039;s always our &quot;secret special guest.&quot; He&#039;d speak highly of what we&#039;re doing (and did to Billboard Magazine in May), if that counts for anything.
