The Famous Haydell Sisters are the biggest act to hit Portland&#039;s comedy country music scene since Portland realized it had a comedy country music scene.  Comprised of sisters Maybelle (the cute one) and Mattie (the other one), they were THE country music teen queens in the early &#039;90&#039;s, toping the charts with original hits such as &quot;7 Seconds (Too Short A Ride)&quot;, &quot;Wrangler Butt&quot;, and &quot;Your Broken Heart (Is No Excuse To Be An Asshole)&quot;.  But, their rising star shot off too quickly, and in 1993 [fueled by a house arrest for one and an eye-opening read of &quot;The Illuminatis! Trilogy&quot; for the other], they disappeared from the scene.  Two decades later, the Haydells are back together, picking themselves up by their aging, sequined bootstraps.  They&#039;ve been holding back their differences to host a variety show in Portland that features a hodge-podge of cast-offs and odd balls that defy categorization and will leave you saying, &quot;That was the best shit-show I have ever seen.&quot;

Here&#039;s why this show is a special opportunity--we&#039;ll take your music acts and weirdos.  This is a chance to have a thematic showcase that is not just pure stand-up or a droning, seated pod cast. Character-based acts, clowning-types, and comedy music Music MUSIC! of all genres would round out this event for a unique offering that could draw folks that have never attended the festival before.  Plus, it&#039;s a chance to expand interpretations of what defines the comedy scene.  

We&#039;ll be your hosts, you send us a handful of acts.  Let&#039;s go Country.

*P.S.: We&#039;re big in Fresno.
