  "bio": "I do a multimedia show called Picture Show. I project stock photos on a screen and do the voices for the characters in the stock photo. I also show my best trolling work. I&#039;ve been featured in a handful of online publications and I created the Customer Service movement, which you can see on my Facebook page, Hope That Helps. Thank you!\r\n\r\n-Ben\r\nwww.facebook.com/wehopethishelps\r\nwww.facebook.com/benpalmercomedy\r\nbenpalmer3000@gmail.com",
  "copy": "The creator of &#039;Customer Service&#039; and &#039;Hope that Helps&#039; brings you stock photography with his own twisted perspective, humorous interactions with companies, police departments, news, and farm Facebook pages, along with sharp responses to entitled customers on company Facebook pages. All projected on a screen.",
