  "bio": "Picture This!, as listed in your list of shows with strong themes, is a successfully touring show in LA/SF/NY and festivals around the country. Each show is a unique one night experience in the mashup of comedians and animators. Ideally we could come back every year like Competitive Erotic Fan Fiction because each show is unique, but we&#039;d at least love to come back since it&#039;s been 3 years since our first show where we nearly sold out the Hollywood Theatre the first year the festival used that venue. Also our monthly franchise in Portland has been over for months so we&#039;d love to come back to Portland. We will source our own animators and can work with the festival to book the comedian spots with other festival performers though Sam Varela needs to be able to influence who is an option for the show since not all performers are a good fit for the show (both newbies and headliners alike.) The following is a description of the show:\r\n\r\nPICTURE THIS! is a new show from Brandie Posey &amp; Sam Varela: two girls who want to push the boundaries of what a comedy show can be. Picture This! is a live comedy show with stand-ups, voice actors and more performing while they are drawn live by some of the best animators, cartoonists, and other artists in the biz! The comedians don’t know what the animators are drawing and the animators don’t know how the comedians will react.\r\n\r\nIt may be weird.\r\nIt may different.\r\nBut it will be FUNNY!\r\n\r\nPicture This! has been going on monthly for over 3 years in LA with both the regular monthly show and special sponsored shows with sponsors like Bento Box Entertainment, Comedy Central’s Brickleberry, Adult Swim’s Mr. Pickles, Netflix’s BoJack Horseman, Cartoon Network and more! The show also has franchised monthly shows in NY, San Francisco and Portland. The show has also debuted in Toronto and the following festivals:\r\n\r\n2013 Adelaide Fringe Festival\r\n2013 Melbourne International Comedy Festival\r\n2013 Bridgetown Comedy Festival\r\n2014 San Francisco Sketchfest\r\n2014 All Jane No Dick Comedy Festival\r\n2015 Green Gravel Comedy Festial\r\n2015 CROM Comedy Festival Denver\r\n2015 Animation Block Party Festival \r\n2015 Hell Yeah Fest\r\n2015 New York Comedy Festival",
