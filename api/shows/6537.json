  "bio": "Mary Mack&#039;s North Star Comedy Hour &amp; Meat Raffle*\r\n\r\nPerformed around various parts of the country for the last six years, The North Star Comedy Hour &amp; Meat Raffle is a variety show featuring good acts and bad meat--raffled off by a fake butcher.  Nationally touring Folk Humorist Mary Mack (usually paired with accordion player Tom Fosmire) is both band and host.  Complete with sing along theme song, this is an interactive comedy show featuring a variety of partially sober performers.  Genres represented in the past have included but are not limited to music, comedy, storytelling, poetry, regular dancing, angry dancing, pet education, French chanson de geste (a retrospective), and Spanish-American War reenactment.  \r\n*Performances usually have one vegan option, or at least some broth.\r\n ",
