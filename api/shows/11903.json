  "bio": "This show satirizes law enforcement and there is no time like now for a show like this! Every time you turn on NPR or the news, a new story is surfacing of cops abusing their authority and if you&#039;re like me, it pisses you off.  Not All Cops Are Bad addresses all of these issues through perspective of Officer Scott Baker, as he tries to justify these viral videos while at the same time revealing sad details about his personal life. The show was voted &quot;Best Scripted Show&quot; at iO West in 2015 and I have performed this character at San Francisco Sketchfest and in St. Louis on the year anniversary of Ferguson. It really connects with the audience and without fail, sparks conversations after every show with people opening up about negative confrontations with law enforcement. I just want to bring this show to new people!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
  "copy": "Winner of iO West 2015 “Best Scripted Show,” this darkly satirical show satirizes law enforcement blunders that continue to be captured in cell phone videos. Follow Officer Scott Baker as he hosts a public relations meeting at the YMCA, plays these videos of police abusing their authority and struggles to save face. From a singing a racist song parody song at a holiday party to beating a horse thief in San Bernardino, Scott attempts to explain details that the video omits and convince the audience that Not All Cops Are Bad! Written and performed by George McAuliffe.",
