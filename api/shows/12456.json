  "bio": "Garrett Palm and Dylan Reiff have been producing the Art-Mondo improv show for the last year and a half using Portland Artists and Musicians as inspiration for long form improv. We do two shows a month, one show in conjunction with the Portland Art Museum where they invite artists and curators to talk about their favorite pieces and their process, and the other at Kickstand Comedy Space where we invite musicians such as The Thermals, Summer Cannibals, Guantanamo Baywatch to play music and chat about what inspired their songs and the meaning behind them. Improvisers listen to the artists and do scenes inspired by the music/artists stories. The shows have been sold out monthly at Portland Art Museum and its a great way to marry PDX awesome music and comedy scenes. We would be interested in using some of Garrett and my improv friends Chris Gethard, Jon Gabrus, Eliza Skinner... or any other comics already coming into town as stand ups who double duty as improvisers.",
