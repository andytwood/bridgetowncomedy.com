  "bio": "The Famous Haydell Sisters are the biggest act to hit Portland&#039;s comedy country music scene since Portland realized it had a comedy country music scene.  Comprised of sisters Maybelle (the cute one) and Mattie (the other one), they were THE country music teen queens in the early &#039;90&#039;s, toping the charts with original hits such as &quot;7 Seconds (Too Short A Ride)&quot;, &quot;Wrangler Butt&quot;, and &quot;Your Broken Heart (Is No Excuse To Be An Asshole)&quot;.  But, their rising star shot off too quickly, and in 1993 [fueled by a house arrest for one and an eye-opening read of &quot;The Illuminatis! Trilogy&quot; for the other], they disappeared from the scene.  Two decades later, the Haydells are back together, picking themselves up by their aging, sequined bootstraps.  They&#039;ve been holding back their differences to host a variety show in Portland that features a hodge-podge of cast-offs and odd balls that defy categorization and will leave you saying, &quot;That was the best shit-show I have ever seen.&quot;\r\n\r\nHere&#039;s why this show is a special opportunity--we&#039;ll take your music acts and weirdos.  This is a chance to have a thematic showcase that is not just pure stand-up or a droning, seated pod cast. Character-based acts, clowning-types, and comedy music Music MUSIC! of all genres would round out this event for a unique offering that could draw folks that have never attended the festival before.  Plus, it&#039;s a chance to expand interpretations of what defines the comedy scene.  \r\n\r\nWe&#039;ll be your hosts, you send us a handful of acts.  Let&#039;s go Country.\r\n\r\n*P.S.: We&#039;re big in Fresno.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
  "copy": "COMEDY. COUNTRY. MUSIC.\r\nThe Famous Haydell Sisters rose to meteoric stardom in the late 80&#039;s and early 90&#039;s as country music teen queens. With such hits as &quot;7 Seconds (Too Short A Ride)&quot;, &quot;Wrangler Butt&quot;, and &quot;Your Broken Heart (Is No Excuse To Be An Asshole), they were part of the soundtrack of America.  But, like all projectiles, they were doomed to crash, and in 1993 (due to a flopped album, a house arrest, and an &quot;Illuminatus! Trilogy&quot;-induced melt-down), the sisters parted ways.  Now, after a 20 year hiatus, Maybelle (The Cute One) and Mattie (The Other One) have brought the act back together and are playing the hits, old and new, along with a cast of scraped-from-the-barrell-bottom characters.  It&#039;s country music the way you WISH you remembered it. www.thefamoushaydellsisters.com\r\n",
