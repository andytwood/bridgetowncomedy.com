  "bio": "We get a real guy from OkCupid and set him up on three blind dates with three real ladies from OkCupid - all live on stage. Amanda and Eli (and the audience) coach the guy through the awkwardness and obstacles of each date. As a bonus, each date is interrupted by some fictional character from the guys&#039;s past who just happens to be in the restaurant. \r\n\r\nThe OkCupid Show has been running at UCB for almost four years now and we are currently working with Sony to develop it for TV.\r\n\r\nThis show is reality tv on stage. It is weird and awkward and intense and super hilarious. A funny car crash you can&#039;t stop watching.",
  "copy": "Real people, real dates, live on stage in front of a real audience. \r\n\r\nRemember that time you sat next to that awkward couple on a first date and couldn&#039;t help but listen in? Fascinating, right? This show takes that moment and puts it on stage - no more hiding your eavesdropping behind a menu. Love scientists Amanda Sitko and Eli Newell guide a real dude through three real dates with three real ladies and it gets real weird. \r\n\r\nThe OkCupid Show has been playing to sold out houses at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater in Los Angeles for the last four years and is finally making its way up to the Great NorthWest. Featuring some of LA&#039;s top improvisers, this show takes you on a journey you&#039;ll never forget. ",
