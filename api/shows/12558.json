  "bio": "From Paul Provenza and Troy Conrad... Set List: Stand-Up Without A Net. \r\nComics are given outrageous, never-before-seen topics in the moment, and perform as if it was the material they meant to do. Both the comic and the audience see the topics for the first time on the on-stage screen, and thus begins the  most exciting, edge-of-your seat stand-up show.\r\nSet List is also a 60-episode web series on the Nerdist Channel and  a successful TV series in the UK.\r\nPast performers on Set List include Greg Proops, Bob Odenkirk, Bobcat Goldthwait, Marc Maron, Reggie Watts, Jeff Garlin, Fred Willard, Roseanne Barr, Paul F. Tompkins, Russell Peters, Gilbert Gottfried, Drew Carey, Jim Norton, Hannibal Buress, Jay Mohr, Margaret Cho, and Eddie Izzard among many others.\r\n",
