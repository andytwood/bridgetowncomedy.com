  "bio": "WHATEVER is a monthly stand up comedy showcase where anything can happen. Hosts and IRL BFFs Allen Strickland Williams and Eric Dadourian first realized that they were meant to be together under a blanket of stars and the influence of psychedelic mushrooms. They have poured all of this passionate, platonic love into creating a show that is all about good vibes, great comics and never-ending friendship. WHATEVER has received endorsements from LA Weekly, Comedy Cake, Rory Scovel, Sara Schaefer, Maria Bamford, Maria Bamford’s dad, and many more.\r\n\r\nAllen puts out digital sketches with his stand-up comedy supergroup WOMEN, which have been featured on Tosh.0 and IFC.com. He also recently appeared as a guest on Conan and has performed comedy on numerous festivals, including Funny or Die’s Oddball Comedy &amp; Curiosity Festival, SXSW and LA’s RIOT Fest. \r\n\r\nEric hosts SAUCE, another popular LA show, and he is a favorite at Hot Tub with Kurt Braunohler and Kristen Schaal. They love him so much that he frequently guest hosts when Kurt and Kristen are unavailable. He can also be seen on Meltdown w/ Jonah and Kumail, Hell Yes Fest and Terrified with Dave Ross. \r\n",
