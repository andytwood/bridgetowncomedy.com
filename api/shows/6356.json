  "bio": "After going on strike from writing Fashion Police, I&#039;ve been submitting to tons of other shows trying to find work. I created this show for writers to read the submissions they&#039;ve written for television shows and magazines that never got them the job. We work really hard and sometimes never get so much as a &quot;thank you.&quot; If we&#039;re not going to be paid in money or employment, we might as well be paid in laughter! \r\nLast night was the first time I put the show up and it was a hit. I didn&#039;t get any video from the show, but I do have the opening video that I played at the beginning of the night. \r\nIf this show gets selected for the festival, I&#039;m sure I could put it together with people that will already be there (I&#039;m assuming.) Like Bryan Cook, Eliza Skinner, Brock Wilbur, Solomon Georgio, and any other of my friends that are submitting. I think this show would be a great fit!",
  "copy": "Writers write a lot of things for submission packets that pass through a producer&#039;s inbox and then never see the light of day. This is our chance to perform our hard work and have a little fun in the process. Created and produced by Todd Masterson. With submissions from The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Chelsea Lately, Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, Saturday Night Live, and much, much more. This night is nutty and a whole lot of fun!",
