  "bio": "Bring The Rock is a storytelling and music show in which the guest/comedian tells a story about a moment in their life that surrounds a song that is important to them, and then with the help of host/comedian Greg Behrendt and his band the Reigning Monarchs they sing that song.  It&#039;s part storytellng show, part live karaoke show.  It&#039;s a mainstay at SF Sketchfest, and a regular show at the Largo in Los Angeles. \r\n\r\nThe joy of the show is getting to hear comedians, actors, musicians and storytellers say stories that you&#039;ve never heard them talk about before as it surrounds their love or hate for a song, and then get to see them perform that song in front of a crowd often not used to hearing them perform music (unless obviously they are musicians, in which case you get to hear them tell stories you rarely get to hear).\r\n\r\nThis show has been around for quite some time, but has taken periodic hiatuses over the years.  It has had amazing guests ranging from Colin Hay, Grant Lee Phillips and Josh Homme to Marc Maron, Chris Hardwick and Moon Zappa.",
  "copy": "Greg Behrendt brings his wildly popular Bring The Rock show to Bridgetown! The Los Angeles Largo staple gives comedians the chance to tell a story about a song from their past- sometimes embarrassing, sometimes sentimental, always funny- and then Greg’s fantastic band The Reigning Monarchs covers the song, often led by the comedian in question. It’s what karaoke should be. ",
