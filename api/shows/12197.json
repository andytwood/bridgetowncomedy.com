THE BAND!&quot; Guests personality, background, and experience will be on full display in sit-down interviews, conducted post performance, also featuring an absurd game or contest, ala Fallon&#039;s &quot;Tonight Show.&quot; \r\n\r\nIn addition to the guests from Bridgetown, WTR&#039;s festival performance will be tailor made to the event, exclusively written and constructed for this engagement. \r\n",
