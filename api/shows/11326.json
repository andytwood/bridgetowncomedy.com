  "bio": "&quot;I Am Vertical&quot; is my solo show best described as a dark comedy about wanting to die, and is comprised of sketches, monologues, puppetry, storytelling, and improv. This show carries the theme of dealing with depression and anxiety, and is based on my own personal experience with clinical depression and suicidal fantasies. This is a very personal show, one that I worked hard on for almost a full year with a fabulous director, Megan Grano, and was so proud to premiere it at the Comedy Central Stage to a packed room of industry and my friends.  In the show, I bring forth all of my skill sets - there is a piece that is completely improvised, and I also have a scene with a puppet, showcasing the skills I learned at the Henson Diversity program this summer. I created this show to share my experience in a truthful yet comedic light, and have been overwhelmed with the positive feedback and support it has received. I&#039;d be honored to bring this show to Bridgetown! ",
