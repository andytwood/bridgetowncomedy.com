If you’re there, you’re eligible to play. Produced and hosted by Ron Funches, David Cope, and Bette Bentley. Audience teams will be formed and battles will be fought featuring games like Soul Calibur, Super Smash Bros, and Street Fighter. Special comedian guests and grand prizes await - sponsored by Portland&#039;s very own Ground Kontrol. \r\n\r\nTHE FACTS:\r\n\r\n - No Pun Intendo is a comedy gaming contest. Acting as team captains, Ron Funches and David Cope form teams from the audience and pit players against each other \r\n   on games we&#039;re playing live at the venue. That means we&#039;re bringing our Xbox down, plugging in, the whole nine yards. Comedian guests help mix things up as \r\n   gamers take each other on. David Cope&#039;s real life fiancé and producer at Funny or Die will be there for post gaming interviews. \r\n\r\n - We&#039;re already a repeat performance at The Nerdist Theater in L.A. Our next show is January 24th.\r\n\r\nCOMEDIAN GUESTS: \r\n\r\n - Our last comedian guests included Richard Bain and Brent Weinbach. On Jan 24th we&#039;re featuring Andy Peters and Josh Fadem. Given we&#039;re accepted for Bridgetown   \r\n   this April,  David and Ron would likely find gaming enthusiast comedians already booked for Bridgetown who&#039;d already be in town and pumped to be part of a \r\n   gaming contest. \r\n\r\nNOTE: \r\n\r\n - The poster we&#039;re supplying is the poster we&#039;ve been using to promote our prior shows. If we&#039;re accepted into Bridgetown we&#039;d update it with the current \r\n    performers.\r\n - No video link BUT here&#039;s a photo collection for our last No Pun Intendo at The Nerdist Theater in L.A.:   http://tinyurl.com/ly7z6al\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   ",
