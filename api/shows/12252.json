  "bio": "The show is a themed storytelling show. Every month, there is a theme, such as DATING or FAMILY. The Storytellers take turns telling their stories while a panel of comedians sit on a couch onstage and interrupt with jokes and questions and commentary. It is the most fun I&#039;ve ever had onstage, and so much fun to watch. Sometimes the stories are amazing on their own. Other times the story doesn&#039;t have much to it, but there are so many details that lead to amazing riffs from the panel. It is truly unpredictable and always a great time. ",
  "copy": "Described as cross between The Moth Radio Hour and Mystery Science Theater 3000, Sorry, Please Continue features some amazing stories told by anyone who wants to participate mixed with commentary from some of the best comedians around. ",
