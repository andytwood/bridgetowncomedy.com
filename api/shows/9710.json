  "bio": "One part comedy show, two parts drinking game, Brew Haha is an interactive mix of standup comedy and your favorite pre-party ritual.  At the beginning of every show, the hosts tell fun stories from past parties and then introduce the crowd to a set of rules created specifically for that show.  When a comic, unbeknownst to them, breaks a rule, the audience drinks. A giant light-up “drink” sign will help the audience play along.  Examples of rules include, &quot;every time a comic uses a funny voice, or sings&quot;, &quot;every time a comic talks about a romantic relationship past or present&quot;, or &quot;every time a comic tries to guess a rule&quot;.  A second game, specifically for the performers, ensures that as the audience gets drunker, so do the comedians.",

So strap on your party hat and make sure you experience the show that a super famous comedian once called “the worst idea for a show ever”.",
