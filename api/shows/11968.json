  "bio": "Ha Fidelity is a stand up show based off your music collection from a particular time in your life (high school, college, that time your girlfriend broke up with you because she couldn&#039;t &quot;commit&quot;). Those songs that saved your life/you couldn&#039;t live without, and now they&#039;re (almost) too embarrassing to admit to. Stand Ups will share a sample track or two during their set to really set the mood. Let&#039;s air it out while we listen to the jams of a time gone by. Phew! \r\n\r\n\r\n",
