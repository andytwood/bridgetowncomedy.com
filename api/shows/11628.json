  "bio": "Festival the Show is an hour to an hour and a half long show that aims to shed light on the hilarities and hypocrisies of festival culture. The show was written in sketch format but has strong story arch and character development. With &quot;tweeners&quot; between every act, the show is captivating from beginning to end. Although it is aimed at addressing festival culture, there are many jokes that are analogous to everyday life. With live music, original song and dance numbers, circus acts, elaborate costuming and larger than life props, there is truly something for everyone. ",
  "copy": "Festival the Show is a  pertinent sketch comedy show that satirizes, entertains, &amp; educates the festival inclined. With catchy original show tunes, elaborate costumes, larger than life props, and high flying circus, acts this show is non-stop entertainment. The creators have recruited a multitalented performance ensemble to take you on a cleverly constructed ride that will take festival goers through the depths of spiritual awakenings, awkward interactions in the sauna, the grief of setting up camp and so much more.  ",
