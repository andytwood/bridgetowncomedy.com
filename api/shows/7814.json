Blam!&quot;, &quot;BLACK MILK&quot; (or &quot;Leite Preto&quot; in Portugese) is a delicious compendium of crisp  comedic  performances and surprising late-night weirdness. \r\n\r\nOn it&#039;s surface, here is a sturdy-walled show with a firm foundation -- solid pedigree. Inside however, it&#039;s Knucklehead City. Straight bananas. The walls will stay up and the roof won&#039;t come crashing but outside of that....\r\nSo, precisely what will go down?\r\nExactly.",
