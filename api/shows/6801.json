We&#039;ve raided the Awful Sketch Vaults of yesteryear and asked our favorite comedians to bring in their earliest, worst sketches... and perform them LIVE. There’s no time to prepare, no time to memorize lines, and nobody but the writer has read them beforehand. It will BLOW YOUR MIND.\r\n\r\nTHE PODCAST / LIVE UCB SHOW\r\nWe release episodes of the podcast twice a month and perform the show during a regular slot at UCB Los Angeles. We&#039;ve also taken the show to SF Sketchfest, will be going to SXSW, and just completed shooting a video version of the show for Funny or Die. \r\n\r\nEach live show / episode lasts about an hour to an hour and a half. The two of us + ­3 guests present a smattering of the worst sketches, pilots, school projects,  stand­up and anything in between that they ever written as a blind table read while stopping to interrupt and poke fun of things along the way. We glance at scripts beforehand, but our goal is to try and keep things surprising by limiting everyone’s knowledge of the material involved, including our own. The writer is only allowed to read stage direction as not to make the material any better than it is. \r\n\r\nSAMPLE EPISODES!\r\n\r\nDan Harmon, Mary Holland, Allan Mcleod\r\nhttp://beforeyouwerefunny.com/2013/09/episode-27-dan-harmon-mary-holland-allan-mcleod/\r\n\r\nRob Delaney, Matt Walsh, Casey Wilson (video also provided for this one)\r\nhttp://beforeyouwerefunny.com/2013/01/episode-10-rob-delaney-matt-walsh-casey-wilson/\r\n\r\nJames Adomian, Mary Lynn Rajskub, Daniel Handler\r\nhttp://beforeyouwerefunny.com/2013/01/episode-11-james-adomian-mary-lynn-rajskub-daniel-handler/\r\n\r\nA bunch more at www.beforeyouwerefunny.com or https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/before-you-were-funny/id547153481?mt=2\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\nJustin + Jacob",
