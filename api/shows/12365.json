  "bio": "Dark Spots is a show that encourages uncomfortable subject matter chosen carefully by the performers selected for the show under a theme picked by the host and producers (Shane Torres, Alison Zeidman, and Nate Fridson). The show prides itself on conquering subjects that maybe considered taboo by many people. Dark Spots also takes a great amount of pride in having performers with different perspectives and experiences on the theme of that months show.  For instance one theme was addiction and performers covered everything food addiction to gambling, to cutting.  While it&#039;s a somewhat untradtional approach to a comedy show it has been something that we are very proud of and has taken on very large and dedicated crowd in here in New York. ",
  "copy": "Dark Spots is a free, monthly comedy show where comedians are asked to perform their darkest, saddest, and most traumatic–but funny–bits. Hosted by Shane Torres (Comedy Bang Bang, Just for Laughs), Nate Fridson (Bridgetown Comedy Festival, AST Records), and Alison Zeidman (Reductress, New York Times), each month performers are asked to do a set inspired by a different dark theme, such as death, illness, depression, divorce, addiction, and more.
