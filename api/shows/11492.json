  "bio": "Everybody in the PNW dresses like they went to take out the trash and just kept walking. Let&#039;s get these funny people in snazzy shirts and suits, in fancy dresses and THEN they can tell their hacky dick jokes! As with my other shows, I focus on booking everybody BUT your standard-issue able-bodied straight white cismale in a hoodie. But he&#039;s welcome to work the door.",
  "copy": "A stand-up comedy cocktail party with fancy clothes and sleazy jokes! Join &quot;Brodie the Lounge Singer&quot; (Beloved local entertainer Brodie Kelly) and 6 suave sex-sapients as they get dressed up all fancy and start talkin&#039; real funny. The amazing, the irascible, the indomitable Ira Novos plays piano between sets, because if time itself can&#039;t stop him nobody can!",
