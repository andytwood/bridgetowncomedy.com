It is a monthly show at Nerdmelt Showroom at Meltdown Comics in Los Angeles. The Tinkle Twins have no idea that the fact that they are a man and a woman, are different ages and have different parents would make it impossible for them to be exact replicas of one another. The Twins host a jacked-up fake kids show with stand up guests, characters and music. The twins set the joyful creepy mood for the first 30 minutes of the show. ",
