  "bio": "Bad Comedy Theatre is a show where comics show clips of their earliest attempts at stand-up on a video screen and do a running director&#039;s commentary making fun of how bad they are. It&#039;s fun. Audiences have a great time because they get to laugh at the awkwardness and bad jokes in the videos, plus the comics&#039; commentary. I&#039;ve done the show in Milwaukee and Chicago.\r\n\r\nFor unknown comics, I ask them to do 3-4 minutes of strong material at the top before we show their videos just to establish the contrast between where they are today vs. where they once were. Obviously not needed for a bigger name comic but they are welcome to do a little time at the top as well. I like to have 5 comics doing about 10-12 minutes each, including video commentary.\r\n\r\nI would book this show entirely with Bridgetown comics. I would defer to you on that regarding who you&#039;d like in the show. The one thing to consider is making sure comics have clips of their earliest attempts, but I haven&#039;t found it to be a problem. Most comics who&#039;ve started in the last 10 years or so seem to have videos.\r\n\r\n",
