  "bio": "Hecklevision is bad movies made better with guest comics and the audience texting jokes on-screen instantly!\r\n\r\nUm, as you&#039;re aware I submitted this last year and it was accepted but didn&#039;t work out due to scheduling conflicts so I&#039;m trying again!\r\n\r\nHollywood Theatre could do this at 9:30pm on Saturday 6/4 or Sunday 6/5 so let me know what you think! Tech needs would be covered by Hollywood.\r\n\r\nPS. It required a video so I just I linked the Hackers trailer but we can do anything!",
