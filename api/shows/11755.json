  "bio": "Secrets, Lies &amp; Alibis is a one-of-a-kind variety showcase inspired by anonymous audience secrets. Every month our fans spill their guts and we create new sketches and games based on their confessions. Additionally, we have Chicago&#039;s best stand-up, characters and comedy music throughout the show. We typically run about 70-90 minutes.\r\n\r\nFor a festival show, we would make some adjustments to be accommodating. All the variety spots could be for stand-ups and we could fit anywhere from 4-7 stand ups (depending on timing) into the show. We would also ideally get secrets from that nights audience to use in the games and perform a couple of our &quot;best of&quot; sketches. \r\n\r\nThis show is so much fun because it&#039;s audience interactive. People love to see their secrets come to life and participate in the games. It&#039;s a high-energy, unique concept that has gotten rave reviews. We&#039;ve been a recommended pick by the Chicago Reader and featured in the Red Eye multiple times. As one of the fastest growing monthly shows in Chicago, we have an ever-expanding, loyal audience. \r\n\r\nSecrets, Lies &amp; Alibis is produced, written and performed by Sarah Albritton, Amanda Lynn Deal, Elliot Lerner and Alex Seligsohn. Mostly women-produced, 1/2 Jewish, 100% weird and fun! The producers have performed in festivals and clubs throughout the country including Arch City Comedy Festival, Cleveland Comedy Festival, Funny Women&#039;s Fest LA, Chicago Nerd Comedy Festival, Zanies Comedy Clubs, The Improv and Kill Tony Podcast. \r\n\r\nWe&#039;ve had some fantastic guest performers including Sean White, Chris Redd, Emily Galati, Martin Morrow, Marty DeRosa, Jacob Williams, Sonia Denis, Felonius Munk, Dave Helem and Jay Washington, among others. \r\n\r\nFor more information, please visit our website and social media;\r\nwww.slacomedyshow.com\r\nwww.twitter.com/slacomedyshow\r\nwww.facebook.com/slacomedyshow",
