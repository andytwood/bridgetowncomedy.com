  "bio": "For the show, we would essentially have 5-7 comics attempt to perform their original comedy after eating a habanero pepper, in addition to having a live Spicy News, and a  live Spicy Interview, which you can see examples of in our submission video. Additional info regarding show is in the second half of our submission video. ",
  "copy": "Conceived by Portland comedian and Oregon native Craig May, The Spicy News was born when a group of friends believed that it would be funny to watch comedians read celebrity gossip, but only after eating one of the hottest naturally occurring chillies on the planet. After soliciting the help of local hero and champion of industry, Ian Karmel, The Spicy News quickly began to carve out a following of comedy enthusiasts, and masochists alike.\r\n\r\nOver the past year Spicy has solicited help from some of the Portland’s top comedians, and some of LA and NYC’s finest as well, not only including Pete Holmes, Kyle Kinane, Mary Mack, Myq Kaplan, Andy Haynes, Nick Turner, Dave Hill, Brandon Vaughn, Nate Bargatze, and Ian Karmel. Spicy was also recently featured on Oregon Public Broadcasting’s Live Wire Radio, and has been featured at the Brody Theater in Portland, OR, The Comedy Underground in Seattle, WA, and the Bumbershoot Music &amp; Arts Festival.\r\n\r\n&quot;So dumb it&#039;s actually kind of funny&quot; \r\n~The Portland Mercury\r\n\r\nOn a scale from one to ten, Spicy News is incredibly dumb, yet surprisingly refreshing.",
