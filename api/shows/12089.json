Computer Show hit the Internet by storm this fall and only had their first “LIVE&quot; performance at the SF Sketch Fest a month ago. Computer Show is the brainchild of Sandwich Video’s Adam Lisagor and Roxana and Tony Altamirano. Gary Fabert (The host) is played by Rob Baedeker of legendary SF sketch group Kasper Hauser.  It&#039;s as simple as this: The show and its hosts are from 1983, and the guests (real tech entrepreneurs) are from the present.  \r\n\r\nhttp://computer.show\r\n",
  "copy": "&quot;Computer Show&quot; is a technology talk show, set in 1983. The dawn of the personal computing revolution. Awkward hair and awkward suits. Primitive synths and crude graphics. VHS tapes. No Internet. But there&#039;s a twist.\r\n\r\nThe guests on this show are tech luminaries -- experts, founders, thinkers, entrepreneurs...from 2016. They are real, and they are really on &quot;Computer Show&quot; to talk about their thing. Will it go well? Can they break through to the host Gary Fabert (played by Rob Baedeker of the legendary SF-based sketch mainstay Kasper Hauser) and his rotating cast of co-hosts, who know of neither iPhone nor website nor Twitter nor...hardly anything?\r\n\r\nhttp://computer.show",
