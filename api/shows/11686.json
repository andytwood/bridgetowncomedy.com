  "bio": "Funny Over Everything is a comedy show that was the highest attended of the 2015 festival according to Sean Jordan so maybe that&#039;s true who knows. It was packed though. It features Portland home champs Ian Karmel, Sean Jordan, Shane Torres, and Phil Schallberger and away champs to be determined by the folks running the show. The show is largely geared toward promoting comics who have the material but not necessarily the name recognition that would make them a known quantity. ",
  "copy": "The Pacific Northwest is becoming a comedy hot bed, and thanks to the Bridgetown Comedy Festival and the nurturing environment of the city, Portland is a scene on the verge. The goal of Funny Over Everything is to put together an entertaining show, but one with a curatorial eye towards the comedians involved. This isn’t an open-mic, and nobody is getting booked because they’re nice.\r\n\r\nThe Funny Over Everything comedy showcase is a monthly series showcasing some of the best, most innovative up-and-coming stand-up comedians that the nation has to offer. Past performers include Moshe Kasher, Ron Funches, Hannibal Buress, Jerrod Carmichael, Doug Benson, Emily Heller, Ian Karmel, Timmy Williams, Sean Jordan and Shane Torres. - See more at: http://hollywoodtheatre.org/funny-over-everything/#sthash.QFotaq4x.dpuf",
