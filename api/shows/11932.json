  "bio": "We wrote this show to throw a party for our fellow nerds and queens. Knowing that everyone’s got a little queen and geek in them, we touch on a range of topics from Russian lit, Batman vs. Superman, proper bloody Mary recipes, podcast voices, Greek mythology and much much more.  It’s interactive. There’s music and dancing. It’s the best type of comedy freak show out there! ",
  "copy": "“Queen Dweebs” is a royally nerdy sketch show featuring the Chicago duo Pure &amp; Weary (Katherine Biskupic &amp; Leah Frires). This show celebrates the unique and helps you find the dignity you lost in middle school. Pure &amp; Weary have previously geeked out with the Chicago Sketch Comedy Festival, the Dallas Comedy Festival, the Chicago Improv Festival, the iO Really Good Film Festival, Chicago Women&#039;s Funny Festival, The New Movement Theater-New Orleans and the Crossroads Comedy Festival. Come let your freak flag fly and join us for this crowning moment! ",
