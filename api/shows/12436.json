  "bio": "Burn Heal is a combination of Stand Up Comedy and Oddball Video Games!\r\nComics are each given a short set to show off their funny side, and then are thrown into a competitive, frenetic tournament. Gabriella Fox (Showtime, Comedy Central, HBO) and Phillip Binder (Dreamworks, Comedy Central), the hosts of the show, categorize the odd and nostalgic video game titles (Gang Beasts, Nidhogg, Mount Your Friends) that range from new and odd to old and broken. The comics are each mic&#039;d and provide color commentary along with the hosts. \r\nThe show is separated into 2 comics each doing 10 minutes of material, followed by the SAME COMICS playing a game they&#039;ve probably never heard of. Rules are explained through video clips and a practice round is given for familiarity. It&#039;s four comics total, with the final game being a championship round. \r\nThe games, being absolutely non-intuitive, strike a chord with hardcore gamers and people just looking for a spectacle.\r\nPrevious performers include Brent Weinbach, Matt Donaher, Emmy Blotnick, and Whitmer Thomas.\r\n",
  "copy": "BURN HEAL exists only to make stand up comics do good at something else: video games. Hosts Gabriella Fox (Showtime, Comedy Central, HBO) and Phillip Binder (Dreamworks, Comedy Central) categorize the odd and nostalgic video games from the edges of the internet. Comics do their set, that&#039;s what they&#039;re comfortable with, followed by the most non-intuitive games dug up from the darknet.",
