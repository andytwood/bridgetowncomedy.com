  "bio": "The Blackout Diaries is a comedy show were standup comedians, plus ‘regular’ people (cops, firefighters, teachers, etc) tell true drinking stories. After each person tells a story, the host, Sean Flannery, then moderates a Q&amp;A session where the audience can ask questions about the story (&quot;were you arrested?&quot;, &quot;what happened to the car?&quot;, etc).  The show is multimedia: if people have photos or voicemails or videos from their drinking stories, we display those while they share the story.\r\n\r\nTypically, we book 3 comics and 2 &#039;normal people&#039; per show.  When the show travels, the normal people are usually fans of our podcast or we reach out to local bars or breweries that might be interested in participating.  Either way, we usually find a few avid drinkings who are excited to participate.  For comics, at festivals, we typically pull our them from the festival pool.  The show has appeared at Just For Laughs (Chicago), Laugh Fest (Grand Rapids) and Dallas Comedy Festival.\r\n\r\nThe show is 90 minutes long, but can be done as a shorter version.  Past performers on the show include Kyle Kinane, Matt Braunger, Hannibal Burres, and more.  In Chicago, the show averages just under 100 people a week and has been a critics pick in most newspapers.",

Then you, the audience can ask them questions.  Participants also bring photos, voicemails and videos from the events, which are displayed while they tell the stories, to hilarious effect.\r\n\r\nThe show was developed in Chicago, where it regularly sells-out and has been named one of the best live comedy shows (Chicago Tribune, Chicago Reader, and more).  It has appeared in several comedy festivals and was launched as a podcast in late 2013.  Fans describe the show as a &quot;reverse AA meeting&quot; where people  tell hilariously embarrassing stories, only to receive laughter and further encouragement to drink.",
