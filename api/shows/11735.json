Topics range from selling candy to pay for a girlfriend’s abortion to hooking up with a transsexual in Mexico City. It’s a raw and hilarious show that is complimented by Dan’s neuroses and Sean’s easygoing charm. Past guests include Nikki Glazer, Chris Gethard, Kurt Metzger, and Abbi Jacobson &amp; Ilana Glazer.",
