After a few years absence, they return to Bridgetown with a stellar lineup: Rachel Dratch (&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;),  John Michael Higgins (&quot;A Mighty Wind&quot;),  Jessica Makinson (&quot;Halfway Home&quot;), Oscar Nunez (&quot;The Office&quot;) Cole Stratton (&quot;Pop My Culture Podcast&quot;) and Janet Varney (&quot;Burning Love&quot;).
