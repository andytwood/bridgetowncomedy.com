  "bio": "Based in Denver, Colorado the Grawlix consists of comics Adam Cayton-Holland, Andrew Orvedhal and Ben Roy. The three of us host the show with a sketch up top - sweet, sweet banter between the three of us - and then some standup with a video or two thrown in for good measure. After much experimentation we&#039;ve found that the up-front with the three of us, then a video, then pretty much a stand-up show after that (with the three of us taking turns MCing, usually with some running through-line we conceive on the fly) is the best way to pull this show off. We&#039;ve done The Grawlix at Bridgetown before, as well as SXSW, The New York Comedy Festival, Riot LA and the High Plains Comedy Festival. We also just filmed a pilot for TRU TV and by the time Bridgetown rolls around we could very well have had that pilot picked up so we&#039;ll be MEGA HUGE STARTS BUT STILL WITH HUMBLE ATTITUDES AND GOOD TIME VIBES.

  "copy": "Based in Denver, Colorado, The Grawlix is the world&#039;s best comedy show that consists of Adam Cayton-Holland, Andrew Orvedahl and Ben Roy. A combination of sketch, video and stand-up (let&#039;s be honest, mostly stand-up) the Grawlix has performed at such festivals as Bridgetown, SXSW, The New York Comedy Festival, Riot LA, Crom Comedy Festival and the High Plains Comedy Festival. The Grawlix recently filmed a pilot for TRU TV entitled &quot;Those Who Can&#039;t.&quot; The process swelled their heads and egos, but not to the point where they are totally insufferable.
