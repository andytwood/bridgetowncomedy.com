  "bio": "Obsessed is a comedy podcast about liking things a lot, maybe even a little too much. The show balances the intimacy and soul baring intensity of an interview style podcast with weird quizzes and games that make for big comedy.\r\n\r\nIt’s a unique mix of super honest and super absurd. On one recent episode, a guest demonstrated what it would sound like if he swore at a nun over a Soccer game. During the same episode, he broke down in tears talking about his father. \r\n\r\nTopics for the podcast have included big, obvious, fun pop culture things like Star Wars, James Bond, and Batman, but also odd, deeply personal topics like being obsessed with self-loathing, tiny things, and the apocalypse.  \r\n\r\nAs a result, the show ends up being an exploration of both the topic and the guests. A lot of times, as the host, I’ll ask a guest a ridiculous question. They start to answer with what they think is their “comedy answer” and end up saying something deep and honest.\r\n\r\nI’ve done the show live many times in my former hometown of Minneapolis, at many conventions and festivals, and I’m starting to do them live in LA. For a show at Bridgetown, I’d love to get a collection of awesome comedians together and get to the heart of their obsessions. \r\n",
  "copy": "A live edition of the Feral Audio comedy podcast, OBSESSED. Hosted by comedian/writer Joseph Scrimshaw (RiffTrax, SF SketchFest), guests share their deepest loves from Star Wars to Pro-Wrestling to Cats to Self-Loathing and everything in between. It’s a fast, funny look at things we like a little too much.\r\n\r\nThe show features probing interviews, absurd quizzes, and ratings to determine exactly how obsessed the guests are with their topic: Would they get a tattoo? Would they talk to Hitler about it? Would they swear at a nun if she insulted the thing they loved?\r\n\r\nThe show has been listed on iTunes as a “Staff Favorite” multiple times since it kicked off in 2012. Past guests include Jackie Kashian, James Urbaniak, Wil Wheaton, The Doubleclicks, David Huntsberger, Solomon Georgio, Matt Gourley, Bill Corbett, Brock Wilbur, Matt Belknap, and many more.\r\n",
