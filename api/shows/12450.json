  "bio": "**Honestly the show description is pretty brilliant, but this show has really been growing over the past year, and Ron Jeremy starred in it during the NY Comedy Festival this year. It&#039;s quite the experience **\r\n\r\nA few years ago, comedian and bored drunk Kyle Ayers decided to post a fake job on Craigslist, out of pure curiousity. He put an ad up, claiming to be a producer for a very prominant adult film (porn) company. &quot;Send me your best three to four page porn script. I want to find the &#039;next big thing in adult film writing.&#039; And make it weird.&quot;\r\n\r\nHe wasn&#039;t sure what to expect, but he certainly didn&#039;t expect the flood of responses. Over 1,000 responses in just under a week. Musicals, movie spoofs, personal experiences put down on pages, sex toys you&#039;ve never even heard of, everything. Over a thousand scripts and (still!) growing. After a while, Kyle decided it was time to do something with these scripts. \r\n\r\nUsing the talents of some of the best comedians around (and willing members of the audience!), First Comes Love honors this aspiring porn writers by acting these scripts out, live on stage. Word for word, line for line, typo for typo, comedians, actors, and audience members pay tribute through performance, and get really, really weird. Props, costumes, everything that would make up a bad high school theater production.\r\n\r\nFirst Comes Love has been featured in the Brooklyn Comedy Festival, the NerdMelt Showroom in Los Angeles, RIOT festival in LA, COME AND TAKE IT COMEDY festival in Houston, and has been standing room only for all of its shows. A show on the rise, it has big things planned moving forward. ",
