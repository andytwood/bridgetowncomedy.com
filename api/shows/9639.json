The show focuses on storytelling with new episodes every Toozdee.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chemistry between Ryan and Jay enables them to take the conversation anywhere, often making light of some heavier subjects.  They make their guests feel like family and their listeners feel like they’re sitting around sharing stories with old friends. \r\n\r\n\r\nPart of the All Things Comedy family, they’ve appeared on Ovation’s ‘The Art of Comedy’, TBS&#039;s ‘The Pete Holmes Show’, Live at the LA Podfest, The Damon Bruce Radio Show and were finalists in the 2013 Stitcher Awards for Best Comedy Podcast.  \r\n\r\n\r\nPull up a chair, grab a coupla cold ones and celebrate the things that Ryan and Jay love most — storytelling, family, friends and comedy.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
