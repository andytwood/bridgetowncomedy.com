  "bio": "&quot;Beloved comedian Guy Branum hosts the ultimate test of banter in a thrilling combination of America’s two least respected television formats. Three guests face off to prove who’s the best talk show guest by plugging, name-dropping, and anecdoteing their way to victory. &quot;\r\n\r\nAs far as show format, it&#039;s a 60-90 minute show. Guy hosts and does a quick monologue, scorekeeper and judges are introduced, and then one guest comes out at a time for a timed interview/competition round. After all 3 guests have been interviewed/competed, the last round is a lightning round of question answering and the winner is revealed. \r\n\r\nSo could use 3 comics that will already be up there, and even judges as I&#039;m sure some of the people going have done the show before in LA or NY. Scorekeeper is usually Whitmer Thomas or Jay Weingarten but I assume any younger adorable comedian that Guy can lovingly objectify while they keep tally will suffice.",
