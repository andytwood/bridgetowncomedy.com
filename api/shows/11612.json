Hosted by comedian Jeremy Eli and co-produced by writer/podcaster Jason Lamb, Minority Retort has quickly become one of Portland’s most popular and critically acclaimed comedy shows. Our goal is to provide comedians of color with a platform to speak their minds and share their unique perspectives, as well as reach the diverse comedy audience that exists within the so-called &quot;whitest city in America&quot;.  \r\n\r\nNational headliners Baron Vaughn (Netflix’s Grace &amp; Frankie) and Maggie Maye (Conan) have performed on the show, as well as many comics frequently featured in Portland&#039;s Bridgetown Comedy Festival: Curtis Cook, Bri Pruett, Elicia Sanchez, Anthony Lopez, Jeff Oliver, Adam Pasi, David Mascorro, Katie Nguyen and Nathan Brannon (winner of Seattle&#039;s Funniest Person - 2014).
