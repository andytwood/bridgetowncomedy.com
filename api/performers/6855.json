  "bio": "<p>In addition to performing standup comedy for the last decade and \"dancing\" in the background of the nightclub scene in Birdemic 2, Andy is a co-founder and producer of the Bridgetown Comedy Festival and one of the guys behind the LA Podcast Festival. His electrical engineering degree has been gathering dust since his last “real” job ended back in ‘05, and the podcast Probably Science that he co-hosts with Matt Kirshen and Jesse Case is his attempt at remedying that while also getting to nit-pick plot points from Gravity.</p>\n<p>Since moving to Los Angeles in 2011, Andy has stayed busy working on shows including E!’s Love You, Mean It with Whitney Cummings and MTV’s Ridiculousness. You can follow him on Twitter @andytwood, and watch for him acting alongside Rob Corddry and Paul Scheer in the upcoming film Jason Nash Is Married on Comedy Central.</p>\n",
