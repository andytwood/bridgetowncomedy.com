  "bio": "<p>Winner of the 2007 Chicago Comedy Award for Most Innovative Comedian, Sam has been heralded by the press for his ability to make the quirky &quot;hysterical&quot;, and was described as a &quot;stalwart of the emerging Chicago underground comedy scene,&quot; by UR Chicago. Earning his chops at the Chicago Second City Training Center, and IO Chicago (formerly ImprovOlympic), Sam has taken his life experiences and molded them into charming, hilarious, and memorable characters that will have you repeating his lines well after the show. In addition to appearing on the G4 Network&#039;s &quot;Attack of the Show,&quot; he is currently a voice actor, commercial actor, and writer for &quot;Ridiculousness&quot; on MTV.</p>\n",
