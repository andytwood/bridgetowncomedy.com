After graduating, he moved to Los Angeles, and can be seen performing wherever anyone will let him. He’s performed at the Limestone Comedy Festival, was a finalist in the Great American Comedy Festival, and has done no other festivals.</p>\n<p>He also makes videos in which he lies to people that have been featured on WorldStarHipHop, College Humor, What’s Trending, and The Bleacher Report.
