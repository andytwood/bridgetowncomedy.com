  "bio": "<p>JANINE BRITO is a stand up comic, and was a writer and on-air correspondent on the critically acclaimed FX series, Totally Biased with W. Kamau Bell, produced by Chris Rock. </p>\n<p>Janine started doing standup comedy in St. Louis and has performed at clubs and theaters throughout the US and Hong Kong. She is the winner of the 2009 SF Women&#039;s Comedy Competition, and recipient of Rooftop Comedy&#039;s 2010 Silver Nail Award. Praised by 7x7 Magazine as &quot;one of SF&#039;s more daring voices&quot; and one of &quot;the 7 funniest people in town,&quot; she was named the 2011 “Best Comedian with a Message” by the East Bay Express. Her recent festival appearances include Sketchfest, the Bridgetown Comedy Festival and the Glasgow International Comedy Festival.</p>\n<p>W. Kamau Bell calls her “a sarcastic, snarky smart bomb of comedy funk straight from the 80&#039;s,” and the SF Weekly says she’s “a mean lesbian,” but she’s pretty sure that they mean it in a good way.</p>\n",
