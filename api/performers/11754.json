  "bio": "<p>Winner of Just For Laugh&#039;s 2011 Irwin Barker Homegrown Comic Award and NOW Magazine&#039;s 2011 Best of Toronto Award for Best Male Stand-up in 2011, a Canadian Comedy Award-nominee for Best Stand-up in 2012 and another nomination for NOW Magazine&#039;s Best of Toronto Award in 2013, Dave Merheje is making waves as one of the edgiest comics in the country today. Drawing from his Lebanese-Canadian perspective and personal experiences straight from the streets, Merheje is unfettered by political correctness. His &quot;no fear&quot; approach to comedy has gained a loyal following. Pure raging energy, he is electric, aggressive and in-your-face. Nothing is sacred as he fires off on urban life, Middle Eastern politics, Islamic extremists, working in strip clubs, club culture, drugs and masturbation.</p>\n<p>In 2014 Dave returned to Just For Laughs in Montreal, for his FOURTH appearance. This past year has been full of successes for Merheje. He won the 2013 Canadian On Campus Activities (COCA) Performer of the Year award, has been nominated for NOW Magazine&#039;s Best of Toronto &quot;Best Male Stand-up&quot;, and shot several episodes for the upcoming television series Too Much Informationwhich will air on Super Channel!</p>\n",
