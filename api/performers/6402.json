  "bio": "<p>Megan Koester is a writer and comedian (obviously) who resides in Los Angeles (somewhat less obviously). A columnist for VICE, she co-produces Entitlement, a monthly comedy show with other VICE scribes which has had the pleasure to host such notables as Neil Hamburger, Marc Maron, Kyle Kinane, Maria Bamford, Kurt Braunohler and Andy Kindler (who she collaborated with on her &quot;How Not to Be a Stand-Up Comedian&quot; article for VICE). She&#039;s performed at SF Sketchfest, the Hollywood Improv, the SF Punchline, Tomorrow!, The Grawlix, Chicago Underground Comedy, and countless other shows across this great land we call America. She has her very own track on the Holy F**k Live Comedy album, which you can listen to on Spotify if you&#039;re so inclined. She&#039;ll GLADLY do any podcast she&#039;s asked to, up to and including Terrified, Lady to Lady and The Fogelnest Files. She USED to be a staple of those Huffington Post &quot;Women You Should Follow on Twitter&quot; lists until she started making a big stink about them being patronizing; she&#039;s also one third of the all-female (sorry) sketch group Blessed. A Witstream contributor, she&#039;s been featured on Splitsider and is finding it very hard to continue writing this bio in the third person. Most importantly, she has the distinction of being the first person to eat a 6&#039;&#039; flatbread Veggie Delight Subway sandwich on stage, a fact she&#039;ll take to her cold, lonely grave. You can follow her on Twitter at <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/bornferal\">http://www.twitter.com/bornferal</a>.</p>\n",
