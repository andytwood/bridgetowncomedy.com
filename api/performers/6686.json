  "bio": "<p>Katie Nguyen is a Portland-based comedian and vending machine whisperer. She has performed at Curious Comedy Theater, taken part in Dis/orient/ed Comedy, and was a semifinalist in Helium Comedy Club&#039;s Portland&#039;s Funniest Person Contest. Katie’s style can be described as “comedy” and “style.” As an ensemble member at the Brody Theater, Katie performs in a variety of improv, stand-up, and sketch shows, and was once hired to play an Eastern European rhythmic gymnast for a barn full of teachers. Katie also writes sketch, performs, and wears vests with the group Vestivus. From ComedySportz to non-profit fundraisers to Chinese restaurants, Katie’s delighted folks and shamelessly laughed at her own jokes. Watch out for her— she&#039;s very short and easy to lose in crowds.</p>\n",
