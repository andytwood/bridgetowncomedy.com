  "bio": "<p>Jesse Elias is a comedian forged in the infernal flames of San Francisco. He draws creative inspiration from music and literature of the 19th century and cartoons and candy of the 1990s. Over the course of 2012 and 2013 he has performed in festivals such as Bridgetown, Outside Lands, LA Riot, and SF Sketchfest. He has written for the new season of &quot;The Eric Andre Show,&quot; currently airing on Adult Swim. Jesse is also proud of his many gross victories as a Competitive Erotic Fan Fiction writer, available via podcast on nerdist.com.  Jesse learned everything he knows about being funny by studying the comedies of the ancient masters Plautus and Terrence.</p>\n",
