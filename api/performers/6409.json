  "bio": "<p>At the ripe young age of thirty-something, Portland comic Randy Mendez thought it&#039;d be the perfect time to go to college and to start a family. At the same time.</p>\n<p>Some years later now he&#039;s about to graduate and he&#039;s almost fully taught his three-year-old daughter to yell &quot;Fart!&quot; in public spaces. After taking third in the search for Portland&#039;s Funnies Person, the Portland Mercury described Randy as having &quot;a disarming, ebullient stage presence that calls to mind listening to a slightly manic, very inappropriate friend share stories about his fucked-up day.&quot; Randy is way too happy about the wrong parts of that statement.</p>\n<p>Randy has previously been seen at the Seattle International Comedy Competition, Helium Comedy Club, Funny Over Everything, They Mystery Box Show, No Pun Intendo, and many other shows that didn&#039;t pay well, but promised would look great in a bio.</p>\n",
