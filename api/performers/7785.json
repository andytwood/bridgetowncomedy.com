  "bio": "<p>Whitney Streed is a comedian because if she was not, her incessant punning would have no artistic or monetary value whatsoever. She has opened for the likes of Maria Bamford, Rob Delaney and Jackie Kashian, and closed for JCPenney Portraits, but that was a long time ago. Whitney has performed in clubs, pride festivals and sketchy bars across the Pacific Northwest, as well as festivals including Portland’s Bridgetown Comedy Festival, Seattle SketchFest, and the Salt Lake City Comedy Carnivale. She can be seen playing a feminist in two seasons of IFC’s hit show Portlandia. In addition to doing stand-up, Whitney also produces comedy/variety shows, including the Weekly Recurring Humor Night (running since March 2011) and co-producing the satirical infotainment series known as CHAD Chats. She likes glitter.</p>\n",
