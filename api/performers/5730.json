  "bio": "<p>Voted Portland&#039;s #1 Comedian in 2013 by a jury of her peers, aside from the cover of Willamette Week, Amy Miller has also been seen featuring for Maria Bamford, and at the following comedy places: San Francisco Sketchfest, Noise Pop Festival, SF Punchline, Cobb’s Comedy Club, Harvey’s Comedy Club Portland, Helium Comedy Club, The All Jane No Dick Festival, The Siren Nation Festival, Laugh Your Asheville Off, Mississippi Studios Portland, and as a regular headliner at the original Purple Onion. A lead producer/ host/ wrangler in Sylvan Productions, Amy produced a successful Oakland show series that featured Hannibal Buress, Moshe Kasher, Kyle Kinane, Rory Scovel and more.</p>\n<p>Amy Miller gets on stage to tell jokes, and you’re all like, well she doesn’t look funny at ALL. I hope she doesn’t blow this! Maybe I should go for a smoke break? 2 minutes in, your pants have been charmed off by her rosy cheeks and a delicate balance of self-deprecation and ego. 5 minutes in, you start to feel sad for her and sometimes feel the need to go “AWWW” out loud in the middle of her set or, occasionally “YOU’RE ADORABLE.” 10 minutes in you’re not sure if you want to have wild sex with her, or have her pretend to be your mom and tuck you into bed at night while lightly stroking your hair and singing You Are My Sunshine because she’s also an excellent singer. Any exposure above 15 minutes and your head is just a chaotic swirl of love feelings and a crippling fear of eventual heartbreak and rejection at the end of which you decide you should just be best friends. It’s fun!</p>\n<p>She has a podcast called &quot;Sorry About Your Dad.&quot; It’s about dad stuff.</p>\n",
