  "bio": "<p>Lisa Best is one of the fresh faces to come out of the strong south Florida comedy scene.</p>\n<p>At the age of 15, Lisa pooped her pants and her classmate Billy Hidges called her a fartball. Since that pivotal moment of clarity and poo, Lisa began her training to turn embarrassing incidents into hilarity. No longer a novice, she skillfully sucks in her audiences with captivating vulnerability and story-telling flare. Now without pooping herself. </p>\n<p>Now 23 years old, Lisa Best currently resides in Los Angeles. She can be seen in Comedy Central&#039;s Dead Kevin sketch, &quot;Hot Girl Fail,&quot; starring in the film &quot;Something Funny,&quot; and also as a guest star in SyFy&#039;s hit Fangasm. She is also the creator and writer of the mockumentary-style webseries, &quot;The Apartment.&quot;</p>\n",
