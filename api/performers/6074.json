  "bio": "<p>Nathan takes the audience on an unexpected ride full of witty stories, clever punch lines, and amusing shadow puppets. He brings smiles and hilarious anecdotes to the stage every time he grabs the microphone. Nathan also added this sentence because he wanted a higher word count.</p>\n<p>Nathan was named one of the &quot;Top 5 Funniest&quot; of Portland  by the Willamette Week in 2013, Portland&#039;s Funniest Person for 2012, and just opened for Comedian Dave Chappelle throughout Oregon. Last summer, he released his first comedy album, entitled &quot;I Black Out&quot;. He has participated in comedy festivals all over the country, as well as opened for national headliners such as Dave Chappelle, Matt Braunger, Maria Bamford, Arj Barker, Rob Schneider, Bert Kreischer, Larry Miller, and more. Nathan was also seen in NBC’s new series, “Grimm”. Nathan is now seeking a funnier way to end this paragraph.</p>\n",
