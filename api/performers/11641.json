  "bio": "<p>Stephen Agyei &quot;has the whitest teeth in Denver.&quot; One of the city&#039;s most sought after comedians, shines behind a mischievous style industry veteran Lamont Ferguson once memorably described as “calculated fearlessness.” His commanding presence and charming smile translate to instant likability. A Regular at Comedy Works, Stephen has opened for some of the most prominent comedians in the country. Finalist in the 2012 Great American Comedy Festival, winner of the 2012 Comedy Works’ Clean Comedy contest, runner-­up the same year and 3 time finalist in the elite venue’s New Faces contest, the Denver­ based comic has quickly made a name for himself locally. Stephen graduated from the University of Colorado-Boulder with two degrees, and also was a Track and Field athlete at the Division I institution.</p>\n",
