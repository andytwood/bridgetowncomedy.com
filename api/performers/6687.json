  "bio": "<p>Douglas Gale started doing comedy in Seattle in 2003 where he quickly became one of the newest comics in the scene. In the past few years, his comedy has become more personal. From stories about the time he tried to trade places with his reflection in a mirror (high on mushrooms) to his confusion about what is and is not cheese (arugula = not cheese).</p>\n<p>In the past year, he started expanding beyond straight standup and into the world of storytelling. He has won three Moth StorySLAMs in Seattle and competed in a Moth GrandSLAM in 2014. </p>\n<p>In 2013, he was the winner of the Competitive Erotic Fan Fiction show at Bumbershoot. </p>\n<p>He is currently the producer of the monthly Moth StorySLAM in Seattle</p>\n",
