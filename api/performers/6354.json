Metromix Magazine named Steve one of the top comedians in the Twin Cities.</p>\n<p>Steve has been on the road non-stop for the past five years, appearing in some of the best comedy clubs in the country, including opening appearances for Kyle Kinane, Rory Scovel, Dave Attell, Tom Green, Harland Williams, Jim Breuer, Gilbert Gottfried, and Doug Benson.</p>\n<p>In 2010, he performed at the Laugh Your Asheville Off Comedy Festival, and in 2011 he appeared in the prestigious Boston Comedy Festival. In 2012, Steve was named a finalist in CMT&#039;s Next Big Comic Award. His first comedy album, &quot;Stever Fever,&quot; produced by Rooftop Records, came out in 2013, and was named one of the top ten albums of 2013 by Comedy-Reviews.com .
