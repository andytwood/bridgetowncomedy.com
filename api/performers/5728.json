  "bio": "<p>Distributor of high-fives, repository of whiskey, afraid of phones, spiders, and phone-using spiders.  T.J. Chambers is a Los Angeles-based writer and comedian whose work has appeared on NBC, MTV, Lifetime, and other television channels (but let&#039;s be honest we all mostly flip through those three).  As a live performer he has toured the country and graced (seriously, his movements are lithe as hell) every major and minor stage around LA.  Listeners have enjoyed a string of scintillating appearances on podcasts such as Put Your Hands Together, PodCrash, Probably Science, and maybe some others provided they start with &quot;P&quot;, because after all it&#039;s a fun letter with both straight and bendy parts.  Presumably he is also very happy to be making a return to the Bridgetown Comedy Festival, but to be honest we forgot to ask him.</p>\n",
