Since that fateful day in 2006,  the hallmarks of Anthony Roinson&#039;s sets has always been spontaneous brilliance and well written social commentary. Has opened for the likes of Baron Vaughn, Aamer Rahman, Ty Barnett, and Aparna Nancherla. Has performed at Bumbershoot and the Seattle International Comedy Competition.</p>\n",
