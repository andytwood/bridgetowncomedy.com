  "bio": "<p>Richard Bain started doing standup in North Carolina in 2003 and then moved to Portland, Oregon in 2005. After becoming one of Portland’s favorite comedians he decided to move to Los Angeles in 2011. When he’s not on stage making you laugh, he’s probably making videos with his friends better known as Decision Makers Penthouse. Their videos have been featured as Will Ferrell’s favorites on funnyordie.com, and Bain starred in one that was featured on The Tonight Show with Conan O’Brien. Richard has performed at the Laughing skull fest, Bumbershoot, and the LA Riot festival. He recently was featured in a Dead Kevin sketch for comedy central.com.</p>\n",
