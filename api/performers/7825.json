A chatterbox as a child, Rice turned her quirky sense of humor into her life long dream of making people laugh.  </p>\n<p>In 1983 Susan took the jump from professional actress to stand up comic. She moved to Los Angeles and soon found her self appearing on  Evening at the Improv,  Comedy Central as well as George Schlatter&#039; s  Comedy Club.  </p>\n<p>Rice has worked in every venue possible from bars to opening for Jerry Seinfeld, Paula Poundstone, and Rich Shydner.</p>\n",
