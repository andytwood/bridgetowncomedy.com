  "bio": "<p>David Leon is a Chicago native who began his comedy career in Madison, WI. David has shared the stage with many talented performers such as Emo Phillips, TJ Miller, James Adomian and Joey Diaz. David Leon&#039;s style of comedy, best described by the Onion A.V. club, &quot;plays on the yearning sentimentalist and inner-creep&quot; with a &quot;kid-on-sugar-high stage presence.&quot; With a demented persona and unpredictable topics, David Leon puts on a show that demands intensity and imagination from his audience and leaves a smile in their heart.</p>\n",
