  "bio": "<p>Scott Losse is a cat owner and stand-up comedian from Seattle, Washington. He has performed at Bumbershoot: Seattle&#039;s Music &amp; Arts Festival, The Seattle International Comedy Competition, Sketchfest, and lots of other places you&#039;ve never heard of. Scott&#039;s stand-up is smart, absurd, and at times dark. You would probably like it. Scott has appeared on Seattle&#039;s Evening Magazine and is the winner of the 2013 Wenatchee Comedy Festival. His cat&#039;s name is Kitty. She&#039;s a real asshole.</p>\n",
