  "bio": "<p>Joshua Murphy is standup comedian and sporadic sketch writer based out of Chicago, Illinois. Though a young comic on the scene, he has quickly moved up in the comedy world with his personal storytelling and socio-political comedy. He was the winner of the 2010 Bloomington Comedy Festival and a performer at the inaugural Limestone Comedy Festival. He was also a writer for the very popular “Fortnightly Show.” And, based on the writing of this bio, it is unnerving how comfortable he is writing in the third person.</p>\n",
