  "bio": "<p>Rob is an LA based stand up comedian. In addition to doing sets around Los Angeles, he regularly tours the college market where occasionally during his shows two kids seated in the back will start making out. They either find Rob&#039;s act to be incredibly erotic or insufferably boring. His acting work includes national commercials and roles on shows like &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot; and &quot;Ben &amp; Kate.&quot; Currently, he recurs on the third season of Showtime&#039;s &quot;House of Lies.&quot;</p>\n",
