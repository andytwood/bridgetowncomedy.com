  "bio": "<p>Sachi Ezura is a comedian, writer, and producer, who works in development and talent for MTV2. After graduating from Harvard, she chose to disappoint her parents by pursuing a career in comedy. She is a co-writer on the upcoming Girl Code book, available at Urban Outfitters, and has contributed writing to the Huffington Post and Comedy Central Insider. She has produced comedy for the MTV Comedy Showcase, the NY Comedy Festival, Laughter in the Park, Schtick or Treat, the Quarterly Arts Soiree and 50 First Jokes. She co-hosts and produces Sledgehammer, a stand-up open mic at UCB East and Comedy at Alligator Lounge, a free weekly stand-up show. She is also a trained improviser, having completed the Advanced Study program at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater and has performed improv at the Del Close Marathon and the Chicago Improv Festival. She is half Japanese, 1/4 Puerto Rican, 1/8 Swedish, and 1/8 German; and she is willing to milk those facts for whatever diversity showcases she can get on. She was born and raised in New York City and has cried in most public places across Manhattan (and some parts of Brooklyn!)</p>\n",
