  "bio": "<p>Aaron Weaver started doing stand-up in Chicago in 2008, with a point-of-view so specific, so original, and so hilarious that the rest of the Chicago comedy scene quickly took notice. He rapidly became one of Chicago’s most heralded stand-ups, due to his custom brand of absurd soulfulness and his way of exploring all the smartest and stupidest thoughts that go through all of our heads. Aaron has performed regularly at every comedy club, showcase, and pancake house in Chicago, including the Laugh Factory, Zanies, and The Lincoln Lodge. He has also performed at the TBS Just For Laughs Festival (twice), as well as the Boston Comedy Festival.  Since moving to LA in 2013, he was named one of Comedy Central’s “Comics to Watch” by making it to the final round of their nationwide Up Next competition. Aaron’s positive stage persona is a breath of fresh air, particularly if you like breathing things that are really, really funny.</p>\n",
