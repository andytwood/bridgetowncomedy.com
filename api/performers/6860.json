These shows include Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, Chelsea Lately, Guy Code, Love You, Mean It with Whitney Cummings, and Comedy Central Presents. There is a reason Julian is on TV so much, and that is because he is a super fun hang! Man that guy is funny. On and off stage, he really is a great time!</p>\n",
