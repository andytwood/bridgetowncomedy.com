  "bio": "<p>Philip Schallberger is Portlandâ€™s premier (only?) solo sketch-stand-up-whatever performer. He is a recurring guest in the Bridgetown Comedy Festival, and has recently been a part of the SLC Comedy Carnivale, Seattle Sketchfest, and San Francisco Sketchfest. Phil has been doing live comedy performance since 2007, and has only given up a bunch of times since then. The local papers seem to like what Phil does, and chances are you will as well. So give it a shot. Try Phil today.</p>\n",
