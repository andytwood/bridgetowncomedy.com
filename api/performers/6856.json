  "bio": "<p>Jeff B. Davis is a multi-talented actor/comedian, born and bred in Los Angeles, CA.  His career began at age 4 as \"Linus\" in a terribly ill-advised, all-children production of You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown at the Goundlings Theater.  On opening night, Jeff vomited all over his director, then turned and took the stage.   At age 9, Jeff was cast as \"Louis\" in Yul Brynner's final production of The King and I, which toured nationally and closed on Broadway when Jeff was 11, after nearly 800 vomit-free performances.</p>\n<p>In high school Jeff began improvising with Los Angeles ComedySportz, eventually learning the skills he'd later need as a frequent guest on the hit television show Whose Line is it, Anyway?  Jeff has a long list of TV credits, including Steven Martin's NBC comedy The Downer Channel, WB's On the Spot, NBC's Happy Family, the Sarah Silverman Show, Drew Carey's Green Screen Show and Improvaganza, to name just a few.  Jeff spends many nights of the year performing live with \"Whose Line\" stars Ryan Stiles, Greg Proops, and Chip Esten to standing ovations all over North America.  When he's not on stage, Jeff is in Hollywood trying to break George Clooney's record of \"most failed television pilots.\"</p>\n<p>Jeff is currently a guest on CW's reboot of Whose Line is it, Anyway?, and can be heard on the highly-acclaimed, deeply weird Harmontown podcast with NBC's Community creator Dan Harmon.  Listen at your own risk.</p>\n<p>Feel free to bother Jeff on Twitter @JeffBryanDavis.</p>\n",
