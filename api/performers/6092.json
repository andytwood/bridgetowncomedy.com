  "bio": "<p>If the adage is true — that tragedy plus time equals comedy — then Ryan Sickler has paid his dues on the left side of the equation.  Born in Baltimore, Ryan lost his father when he was 16, was thrown into the street by his mother and after that, bounced from one relative to another.  It was finally a great-aunt who gave him the chance to get back on his feet and when he did, he did it like he meant it.</p>\n<p>Ryan worked, saved, finished school, packed all his stuff into garbage bags and drove to Los Angeles to follow his dream of being a comic. And while his early years might have seemed rocky, that tumultuous childhood gave him both fodder for material and armor against the relentless onslaught that is life as a standup comic.</p>\n<p>His television appearances include Comedy Central’s Tosh.O, Live At Gotham, Cutman and The Late Late Show.  Ryan is also an informed sports fan and appeared as a regular on Fox Sports.  He has written for his hometown Baltimore Ravens on NFL.com and for Joan Rivers.</p>\n<p>Beyond standup, Ryan Sickler is an engaging storyteller.  You can catch him every Tuesday on his podcast, The CrabFeast.  Inspired by his hometown, the show celebrates the things Ryan loves most — storytelling, family, friends and comedy.</p>\n",
