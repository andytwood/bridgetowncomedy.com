  "bio": "<p>Acme early in his career, a well known headliner told him that &quot;You&#039;re kind of like an idiot, but with smart material&quot;. That winning combination has led to appearances on CBSâ€™s Late Show with David Letterman, Comedy Central&#039;s Live at Gotham, the Bob and Tom radio show, and Wisconsin Public Radio. Tim has performed at the Rooftop Aspen Comedy Festival, the Great American Comedy Festival in Norfolk, NE, and the Laughing Skull Comedy Festival in Atlanta. Originally from Western Wisconsin, Tim now lives in Minneapolis. When he&#039;s not on stage, Tim enjoys making smart, idiotic videos for his website, timharmston.com.</p>\n",
