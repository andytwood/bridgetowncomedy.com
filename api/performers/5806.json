  "bio": "<p>Monica Nevi is a native of the Seattle, Washington and the product of a wonderfully humorous family and diverse background. While earning her degree at Seattle University and losing her collegiate basketball player career to injuries, Monica decided to move forward with another untraditional path and pursue her strong interest in stand-up comedy. </p>\n<p>She has performed all over the West Coast, in the 2012 Bridgetown Comedy Festival, and in the 2013 Seattle International Comedy Competition. Monica is a regular at the Tacoma Comedy Club, and a drunk woman once told her she was the &quot;funniest skinny white girl&quot; she had ever seen.</p>\n",
