  "bio": "<p>David began performing stand up open mic in Portland, Oregon. It was way more fun than his call center job so he stuck with it. After living and performing in Portland and Seattle he moved to New York City. During his time there he was a semi finalist on Last Comic Standing 2010, nabbed the motion capture role of Jay Norris in Grand Theft Auto V, and co-produced The Hot Soup Comedy Show at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater. His better half moved to L.A., so he did too and now engaged like proper adults they live together in Hollywood where he continues to write and perform comedy. David is a regular at The Portland Bridgetown Comedy Festival and The New York Underground Comedy Festival. He’s the co-creator and producer of No Pun Intendo, Nerdmelt Theater’s first in-house comedy video game competition and produces The Call Of The Blade, a gaming review web series featuring L.A. comedians.</p>\n",
