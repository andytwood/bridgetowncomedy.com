  "bio": "<p>Adrienne is a former professional dancer turned stand up comedian, getting her start in the south Florida comedy scene before moving to Los Angeles in 2012. Full of darkness and angst, her stories are personal and vulnerable with a tendency to throw a left turn at the audience. Adrienne once opened for Patton Oswalt who described her as &quot;Hilarious...and disturbing&quot;; the two things she desires to be the most. Since she&#039;s UCB trained with a lifetime of musical theatre under her belt improv and sketch made perfect sense to dive intoâ€”you can watch Adrienne&#039;s web series &quot;Two Inches Apart&quot; on YouTube and see what it&#039;s like to be an angry young woman in the city.</p>\n",
