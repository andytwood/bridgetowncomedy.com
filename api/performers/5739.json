  "bio": "<p>Mike entered comedy at the tender age of six with clowning classes at the local JCC. He’s been delighting and confounding audiences big and small with his accessibly off-beat brand of humor ever since. A father as well as a fat slob, Mike draws from a broad range of experiences in constructing his act, using outlandish viewpoints and subversive turns of phrase to highlight the inherent absurdity of being. He doesn’t point out life’s quirks; he rolls around and farts on them! A current member of Comedians You Should Know, Chicago’s premiere stand-up comedy collective, Mike is also curator and co-creator of Senorita Weiner&#039;s Top Secret Humor Experiment and Ice Cream Social Club, which is Chicago&#039;s longest-running clandestine comedy show in addition to being the original underground, members-only ice cream social. He is also starting to &quot;make it&quot; on TV where, if you look really closely, when the moon is just right, you may be able to catch a glimpse of tiny Lebo selling little bits of his integrity in order to hawk various products. A &quot;New Face&quot; at the 2013 Montreal Just For Laughs Comedy Festival, Mike has also made funny faces at the 2012 TBS Just For Laughs Festival (Chicago), the 2013 Montreux Comedy Festival (Switzerland) and weirded people out at the 2013 Gilda&#039;s Laughfest in Grand Rapids as well! Fun!</p>\n",
