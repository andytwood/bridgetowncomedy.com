  "bio": "<p>The easiest way to describe Sean Flannery is: he&#039;s attended the wrong wedding (twice). That mostly sums it up.</p>\n<p>On stage, he shares wild, hilarious stories, while showing multimedia from the events: photos, videos, voicemails and more. He recently combined many of these stories into a sold-out, critically-acclaimed one man show, called &quot;Never Been to Paris,&quot; about the last 10 times he nearly killed himself by accident.</p>\n<p>He is also the creator and host of &quot;The Blackout Diaries,&quot; a show where comics plus &#039;real&#039; people (cops, priests, teachers, etc) share true drinking stories and answer questions from the audience.</p>\n<p>He has been named the best comic in Chicago by several publications and his live multimedia shows<br />\nroutinely sellout. He was a featured New Face at Just For Laughs Comedy Festival (Montreal)<br />\nand made his television debut last year, on Comedy Central&#039;s, ”Mashup”.</p>\n",
