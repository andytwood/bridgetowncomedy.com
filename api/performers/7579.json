  "bio": "<p>Henry Phillips  has been seen and heard performing his twisted songs and stories on 'Comedy Central Presents', ABC’s ’Jimmy Kimmel Live’, satellite and terrestrial radio nationwide. His critically acclaimed albums, fusing mellow folk-rock ballads with psychopathic lyrics have earned him mention in Billboard magazine’s ’Critic’s Choice’, as well as acclaim from such notable artists as Moby, who refers to Phillips' songs as \"disconcertingly funny\". His semi-biographical comedy film \"Punching the Clown\" received the Audience award at Slamdance film festival '09, and the sequel is scheduled to shoot this year.</p>\n",
