  "bio": "<p>Charlie Rohrer dropped out of college to tell jokes. Comedy just seemed more viable than a bachelor&#039;s degree in Fine Arts. Growing up the black sheep of an enormous Irish family in the South Suburbs of Chicago, his comedy mostly comes from self-reflection, tales from his awkward childhood, and his unique view on everyday life. </p>\n<p>He co-producers a very successful, independent show in Chicago called &quot;Congrats on Your Success,&quot; and has performed at Zanie’s, Chicago Underground Comedy, Gilda’s Laughfest, and more.</p>\n",
