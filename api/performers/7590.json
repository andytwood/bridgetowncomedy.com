  "bio": "<p>Jensen Karp accidentally found himself with a million dollar record deal at age 19 under the moniker Hot Karl on Interscope Records, where he released songs with Kanye West, Redman, Fabolous, Mya and Will.I.Am. Since his time as a rapper, he’s went on to find himself working in professions a little more fitting for his passion for comedy, opening pop culture art galleries (Gallery1988) and writing for “WWE Raw,” FunnyOrDie &amp; “The Howard Stern Show.” He was also Creative Director at the YouTube channel JASH, where he co-wrote and produced the web series &quot;The ArScheerio Paul Show.&quot; </p>\n<p>He recently appeared on the Yahoo/E! Network show “Burning Love&quot; and has collaborated with “Breaking Bad,” “LOST” and “The Academy Awards” on marketing initiatives  and campaigns. He produces and performs in two reoccurring shows in Los Angeles: &quot;Baby Talk w/ Dan Levy&quot; at the NerdMelt Theater and &quot;The Live Read&quot; at UCB.</p>\n",
