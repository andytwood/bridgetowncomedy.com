  "bio": "<p>Dr. Peter McGraw, a marketing and psychology professor at the University of Colorado Boulder, is an expert in the interdisciplinary fields of emotion and behavioral decision theory. His research examines the interrelationship of judgment, emotion, and choice, with a focus on consumer behavior and public policy. He is becoming a leading force in moving the science of humor from the niche to the mainstream. The advantage that McGraw has over his predecessors is his ability to conduct state-of-the-art experiments with the help of the team he directs at the Humor Research Lab (aka HuRL).McGraw received a B.A. in psychology and M.Ed. in educational psychology from Rutgers University and an M.S. and Ph.D. in quantitative psychology from The Ohio State University. His post-doctoral training was conducted at Princeton’s Woodrow Wilson School. His work has been covered by the BBC, MSNBC, Scientific American, Wall Street Journal, and the Financial Times. Most recently, McGraw made the 2013 Stylish Scientist List – probably because he likes to rock a sweater vest.</p>\n<p>McGraw is the co-author of The Humor Code: A Global Search for What Makes Things Funny.</p>\n",
