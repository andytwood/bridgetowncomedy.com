  "bio": "<p>Jack Martin<br />\nfrom Philadelphia, Pennsylvania<br />\ncurrently lives in Queens, New York</p>\n<p>I&#039;ve been doing stand up since 2007 started at the Laff House in Philadelphia. </p>\n<p>In 2008 I was featured on Comcast Comedy Spotlight (local). </p>\n<p>2009 I made it to the finals of Helium Comedy Clubs Philly&#039;s Phunniest Competition (top 8 out of 150 comedians)</p>\n<p>2010 Me and fellow comic Paul Goodman started a weekly show under the name Rittenhouse Comedy and expanded to 3 other Open Mics throughout the city, it became wildly successful a we were nominated for open mic of the year for a local Comedy award ceremony. Below are a few links to some of the press we received.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.urbansuburbanmagazine.com/bestkept/bestkept_rittenhouse-comedy.htm\">http://www.urbansuburbanmagazine.com/bestkept/bestkept_rittenhouse-comed...</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://citypaper.net/Blogs/TONIGHT-Rittenhouse-Comedy-Noche/\">http://citypaper.net/Blogs/TONIGHT-Rittenhouse-Comedy-Noche/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.witout.net/2011/11/10/the-2011-witout-awards-best-open-mic/\">http://www.witout.net/2011/11/10/the-2011-witout-awards-best-open-mic/</a></p>\n<p>2011 &amp; 2012 I was one of 8 organizers for the March Madness Comedy Competition which unified all the top open mics in the city and was a huge success. Type &quot;March Madness Comedy Philadelphia&quot; on Google, I don&#039;t want to drive you crazy with way to many links but there&#039;s plenty lol.</p>\n<p>2014 I made the decision to move to New York its only a few hours away from Philly and alot of my friends are finding major success. It&#039;s like a training ground for some of the greats. </p>\n<p>The Clubs I&#039;ve performed for in my career are: (non bringers)</p>\n<p>The Laff House, Helium, The Stress Factory, Baltimore Comedy Factory, Eastville Comedy Club, New York Comedy Club, Broadway Comedy Club &amp; The Stand. </p>\n<p>My have many styles of jokes from observational to blue, race relations, impressions &amp; anti-comedy. I can&#039;t tell you what &quot;Type of Comic&quot; I am, that&#039;s in the eye of the beholder. Thanks for the consideration and hope to hear from you soon.</p>\n",
