      "bio": "<p>I started doing standup in 1981, when there weren’t so many jokes. I quickly learned that my comedy wasn’t for everybody, it was for everybody else. The Improv in New York City was my first home. There, being funny onstage was important, but even more so was being funny at the bar with the other comics. In the early days, some of the comedians had a standing bet on how long I’d last on stage. No one guessed it would be thirty-three years. </p>\n<p>My earliest credit was being musical director for Robin Williams, which worked until people realized that he was not a musician. Around that time, the movie House Of Games was released, written by David Mamet, based on a story by the two of us. A few years later, I played a sleazy comedian in his movie, Things Change – a stretch? </p>\n<p>I made my debut on Late Night with David Letterman in 1985 and have returned eight times since. I always pretend to leave something behind. </p>\n<p>Soon, I did The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson – twice, Leno twice, and Conan seven times, but the work that really attracted attention was an animated series I created with Tom Snyder for Comedy Central called Dr. Katz: Professional Therapist. I played the title role and won an Emmy. The show won a Peabody Award. And then Hollywood took an interest: first NBC, then Dreamworks, followed by Paramount where I created a show called Raising Dad, which aired on the WB network. </p>\n<p>I’ve had roles in many animated shows, including Home Movies, Bob’s Burgers, Adventure Time and Explosion Bus, but probably more people have seen me as the social worker in Eddie Murphy’s film Daddy Day Care than in any other role. </p>\n<p>Currently I am working on a book with David Mamet called the The Home for Unfortunate Animals and happen to be living in one, too. </p>\n<p>You can hear me on my podcast Hey, We’re Back on WKATZ.com.</p>\n",

His career began at age 4 as \"Linus\" in a terribly ill-advised, all-children production of You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown at the Goundlings Theater. On opening night, Jeff vomited all over his director, then turned and took the stage. At age 9, Jeff was cast as \"Louis\" in Yul Brynner's final production of The King and I, which toured nationally and closed on Broadway when Jeff was 11, after nearly 800 vomit-free performances.</p>\n<p>In high school Jeff began improvising with Los Angeles ComedySportz, eventually learning the skills he'd later need as a frequent guest on the hit television show Whose Line is it, Anyway? Jeff has a long list of TV credits, including Steven Martin's NBC comedy The Downer Channel, WB's On the Spot, NBC's Happy Family, the Sarah Silverman Show, Drew Carey's Green Screen Show and Improvaganza, to name just a few. Jeff spends many nights of the year performing live with \"Whose Line\" stars Ryan Stiles, Greg Proops, and Chip Esten to standing ovations all over North America. When he's not on stage, Jeff is in Hollywood trying to break George Clooney's record of \"most failed television pilots.\"</p>\n<p>Jeff is currently a guest on CW's reboot of Whose Line is it, Anyway?, and can be heard on the highly-acclaimed, deeply weird Harmontown podcast with NBC's Community creator Dan Harmon.

Kosta and Regis Philbin lead a panel of sports experts in a lighthearted look at the daily happenings in the world of sports. Kosta started out as an athlete; he is quick to point out that he was once-ranked number 864 in the world in professional tennis and earned over $11,000 on tour.  Don&#039;t laugh, that&#039;s $11,000 more than you made as a pro athlete.</p>\n<p>He will next be seen on E!’s The Comments Section, executive produced by Joel McHale and K.P. Anderson (The Soup). The show will focus on deconstructing the often snarky comments on popular websites. </p>\n<p>Kosta gained attention as a comedian when he broke out of the HBO Comedy and Arts Festival in Aspen.  He quickly relocated to Los Angeles where he began his television career; he made regular appearances on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno &amp; Chelsea Lately before both those hosts drowned in their money and ended their shows.  He has performed on Conan, @Midnight, the Just for Laughs Festival in Montreal and also starred in his own comedy special, Comedy Central Presents: Michael Kosta.  As a host, Michael acted as a know-it-all correspondent for E!’s spinoff of The Soup, entitled The Soup Investigates, and was recently seen guest hosting the hit G4 series, Attack of The Show; that stint ended after Kosta caused the show as well as the network to be cancelled (the media says that the network was being reformatted, but we know better).</p>\n<p>His other TV credits include TruTV’s The Smoking Gun Presents, Showtime’s Live Nude Comedy and Michael also hosted the 63rd Annual Emmy Awards’ Backstage Live show.<br />\nKosta has also shot pilots with MTV, NBC, E! and developed a late night talk show with Comedy Central and recently developed his own scripted pilot based on his life, produced by Fox. All of those projects were colossal failures.</p>\n<p>In the sports world, Kosta hosted Fox Sports Network’s CCHA All Access, a hockey show in Detroit, for which he won two “Michigan Emmys” as performer/host. Those are like regular Emmys, but smaller and a lot less prestigious.  He is also the author of a book titled “101 Tips for Winning More Tennis Matches” which earns him quarterly royalty checks of around $110.</p>\n<p>Michael lives in Los Angeles where he hopes to someday become famous and forget the little people.</p>\n",

Since those early days Jay has continued climbing the ranks with multiple TV appearances, many internet short films and his first album, “Self-Diagnosed,” available on iTunes. His voice continues to grow as he has delved into the world of interacting with strangers and creating conflict with people he doesn’t know. Jay is a fantastic storyteller, showcased weekly on The Crabfeast Podcast with co-host Ryan Sickler. With TV projects in development, be sure to catch Jay now before he ignores everyone…forever…seriously…he will.</p>\n",

While it's his prime-time NBC appearances that many comedy fans will recognize him from, they are often surprised at the breadth and scope of his material, described by one reviewer as \"intelligent, but with the emphasis firmly on the funny.\"</p>\n",

      "bio": "<p>Ian Abramson is from Moreno Valley, California, where he learned to walk, read, and drive, but not in that order. He studied theater at California State University Channel Islands, which isn’t on an island, but has been converted from an old mental hospital, so it’s isolated in its own way.  While at school, he took as many performance and writing classes as he could and after trying stand-up at a couple of campus open mics, he decided to start writing comedy.  After finishing school, he briefly lived in Orange County, launching his standup career.</p>\n<p>In search of the best comedy training, Ian moved to Chicago where he began taking improv classes at The Second City and the iO Theatre.  With comic friend Tim Barnes, he co-created The Pitch and Talent Scout’s Honor, both web series for Tom Snyder (of Dr. Katz fame).  Over the course of a year and a half, they made over 50 weekly episodes. Working again with Snyder, he voiced an episode of the producer/writer’s Explosion Bus, featured alongside Daryl Hall of “Hall and Oates.”  Ian is well known for producing events such as A Funeral for a Prop Comic and A Court Case for a Young Comedian.  He insists these are not comedy shows.  He is also a regular contributor for The Onion. </p>\n<p>Ian’s stand-up has evolved into a mix of precise wordplay, longer emotionally absurd jokes, and larger conceptual pieces.  In the past year, Ian has performed at the Oddball Comedy Festival, UP Comedy Club, Milwaukee’s Comedy Cafe, The Lincoln Lodge.  His Seven Minutes in Purgatory is an experimental show where comedians perform to a camera in one room while the audience watches in another room, resulting in the comics having no idea of how they are doing. Chicago Magazine named Ian “Best Experimental Comedian” and also listed him in a separate article as one of the “16 Comedians You Should See This Fall.”  Ian has made Appearances at Funny or Die&#039;s Oddball Festival and the Chicago Comedy Exposition. He has featured for Dave Hill and Bridget Everett at UP Comedy Club and Jimmy Pardo at Jukebox Comedy Club.</p>\n",

Her 2013 invite to Laugh Your Asheville Off Comedy Festival and her 2014 acceptance into the Women In Comedy Festival, along with her recent trip to the Stand Up NBC 2014 NYC semifinals , her recent showing in RiotLA as well as an invite to the HBO/ABFF 2014 comedy wings semifinals, has the industry talking about this young lady.  Opening for power house/veteran acts like Hannibal Burress (Comedy Central), and Rob Stapleton (Comedy Central) has not only helped this rising star hone her skills but has allowed her to branch out, booking shows up and down the east coast.  Performing at comedic institutions from Gotham NYC, Comedy Store LA, Ice House LA, to the Comedy Studio in Cambridge, MA, Sam Johnson is wowing audiences and building her fan base.  Her fresh, unique and warm approach makes Sam Jay a comedian worth seeing and one you will be talking about long after you do.</p>\n",

Matt&#039;s sense of humor and rebellious nature came together when he and his friends opened an illegal comedy club/speakeasy in an abandoned church in Atlanta, paying off local law enforcement, and bringing in some of the best comics in the country to perform.  </p>\n<p>With Matt&#039;s easygoing demeanor, he tackles divisive topics such as police brutality, abortion, and drugs in a way that allows the audience to laugh regardless of their stance on an issue. It&#039;s not all heavy topics, though. Matt stacks the deck by alternating between silly and important subject matter. It&#039;s not at all uncommon for a bit about police murdering an unarmed person to be followed by a joke about how the city of Dubai should add the prefix &quot;shooby&quot; to its name. </p>\n<p>Although raised in poverty by a single mother, Matt feels as though he has had some advantages, especially when it comes to comedy. &quot;When your mom has a drinking problem and your dad did some stints in mental institutions, there&#039;s a pretty fine chance that you&#039;re going to be funnier than most people,&quot; he says. </p>\n<p>On his recent move to Los Angeles: &quot;I rode across the country, bringing with me my only possessions: a motorcycle, some T-shirts, a gun, and one bullet. Sometimes, when you follow your dreams, you end up with a motorcycle, some T-shirts, a gun, and one bullet.&quot;</p>\n",

In 2007, she finished as a finalist in the Stephen Colbert Portland Amateur Comedy Competition, and she is a six time alum of the Bridgetown Comedy Festival. When she’s not busy getting divorced or fighting rheumatic diseases, you can find her performing at comedy clubs, theaters, casinos, and festivals all over the West Coast and beyond. Additionally, she and one of her writing partners are working on a screenplay for a hopeful Lifetime movie.</p>\n<p>When you think of Veronica Heath, think of an anxious unicorn and top shelf cranberry meets low shelf vodka, and then just let it happen.</p>\n",
