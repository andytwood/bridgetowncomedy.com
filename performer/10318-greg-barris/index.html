Greg Barris is a staple in New York’s downtown stand-up scene and is the creator of Heart Of Darkness: a psychedelic showcase of comedy, live music and fringe scientists that has been a frequent Time Out New York critic’s pick, much loved by BrooklynVegan and hailed as ‘Excellent’ by The New Yorker.  Comedians who have appeared on Heart of Darkness include Reggie Watts, Fred Armisen, Janeane Garofalo, Jim Gaffigan, Marc Maron, Kristen Schaal, Eugene Mirman, Greg Behrendt, and Chelsea Peretti.

Barris’s comedic shorts have been featured on Funny or Die, College Humor and Jay Leno's Laugh Squad to name a few.  He has been a commentator on MTV's All That Rocks and MTV's Warren The Ape, and his debut album Shame Wave was released on ASpecialThing Records in 2012.
