Lisa Best is one of the fresh faces to come out of the strong south Florida comedy scene.

At the age of 15, Lisa pooped her pants and her classmate Billy Hidges called her a fartball. Since that pivotal moment of clarity and poo, Lisa began her training to turn embarrassing incidents into hilarity. No longer a novice, she skillfully sucks in her audiences with captivating vulnerability and story-telling flare. Now without pooping herself. 

Now 23 years old, Lisa Best currently resides in Los Angeles. She can be seen in Comedy Central&#039;s Dead Kevin sketch, &quot;Hot Girl Fail,&quot; starring in the film &quot;Something Funny,&quot; and also as a guest star in SyFy&#039;s hit Fangasm. She is also the creator and writer of the mockumentary-style webseries, &quot;The Apartment.&quot;
