Part man, part ageless boy; comedian Dwight Slade has the privilege of being a comedy legend in American stand up.  The winner of the 2008 Boston Comedy Festival, Slade combines an intelligent, raging voice of justice with the snickering attitude of a high school prankster. He gives the impression of a man on a journey who enjoys nothing more than making fun of everything along the way.

The 90’s found Dwight moving into new arenas of creativity.  Radio station KXL-AM billed him as “The Northwest’s Most Dangerous Mind” as he became a noted talk radio personality who used humor instead of rage to engage listeners.  He released two comedy CD’s on Humor Ink recordings, "Weird State," and “Shut-up.”

Slade’s feature film debut came in 2000 in the movie “Inconceivable,” which enjoyed a run on Showtime and Lifetime.  Slade also co-starred in the gritty family drama, “My Way Home” which won the Platinum Award at the 2001 Houston International Film Festival. Since then, Slade has made appearances in three feature films including the soon to be released James Westby film, “Rid Of Me.”

In 2002, Slade became the first stand-up to make appearances at the three major North American Comedy Festivals: Aspen, Chicago and Montreal.  On the heels of his performances, Slade signed a development deal with Warner Brothers Television.  Slade was chosen to appear on HBO’s “Best of the US Comedy Arts Festival” and made an appearance on Comedy Central’s Premium Blend.

Slade’s stand-up has gained international stature after earning a five star review from Scotland’s Minister of Culture at the prestigious Edinburgh Fringe Festival and appearances at the Montreal Just For Laughs Festival.   He followed this with a tour in Afghanistan performing for US Troops, a tour of Israel. After a stellar performance at the 2008 Comedy Festival in Las Vegas, Slade was chosen to appear on a Tonight Show feature. 

Slade’s comedy special “Right &amp; Raunch” is now available on DVD.
