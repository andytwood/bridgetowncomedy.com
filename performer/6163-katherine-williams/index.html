Katherine Williams is a NYC – based stand-up comic, actor and playwright. She graduated from James Madison University in her native Virginia and attended the Atlantic conservatory (founded by David Mamet and William H. Macy) in New York. 

As a stand-up comic, Katherine is a chronic oversharer, from her awkward attempts at intimacy to quieting the paranoid voices in her head. The youngest child from a devout Irish Catholic family, she experiences soul-crushing guilt and constant shame on a near-daily basis.

Six of her plays have been produced in Manhattan including My Dead Mother is Funnier Than You (Plaidbird Productions) and The Shih Tzu Doesn’t Like Lesbians (On the Leesh Productions).  Her comedic solo show, CALL ME, was accepted into three New York theater festivals in 2010 - 2011, including the Midtown International Theatre Festival. Katherine has performed in the New York Underground Comedy Festival (2009, 2010) and the New York International Fringe Festival (2009, in Meryl Cohn’s sold-out hit, And Sophie Comes Too). Her work has been reviewed by Show Business Weekly and nytheatre.com. She was recently interviewed for Morgan Spurlock’s latest venture, Failure Club, an online series for Yahoo.
