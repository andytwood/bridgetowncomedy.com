Natasha Muse is funny. She began performing in 2001 as “Ginger” at AsiaSF. Her friends claimed she was much too shy to be a good performer, and the fact that they were right didn’t stop her from trying it anyway. But, eventually, she sorta proved them all wrong.

In 2008, Natasha made the leap from lip-synching to stand-up comedy, and began to create a buzz in the San Francisco comedy scene. Her cerebral wit, whimsical wordplay, and unique perspective on life have earned her the adoration of audiences and the respect of her peers. She’s guaranteed to be at least the second-funniest transexual you know.

Natasha performs all over the Bay Area, including Cobb’s Comedy, the SF Punchline, Harvey’s, and the Dark Room. She has worked with such people as Wyatt Cenac, Pete Holmes, Ron Lynch, and Laurie Kilmartin.

In addition to stand-up, Natasha produced and hosted the monthly underground hit “A Funny Night for Comedy” at the Actors’ Theatre, the cult podcast “Too Soon,&quot; and writes and performs with the sketch group Femikaze. She has also been declared &quot;a force to be reckoned with on Twitter.&quot;

In 2013 the SF Weekly said she was a &quot;Comedian to Watch,&quot; and in 2012 they chose her as &quot;The Funniest Tranny in SF.&quot; 

Natasha has performed in Sketchfest 2013 and 2014, Comedy Day 2012 and 2011, and the first and only SF Comedy and Burrito Festival in 2012. She is also the winner of the 2010 Battle of the Bay competition, Miss Toolbox 2011, and also took home the Miss Photogenic trophy in Model Search 2004.
