Andy was hit in the head by a bird as a kid, and thatâ€™s how she got her powers. Soon after, she decided to be a comedian. In 2009 she was voted MVP at the Aspen Rooftop College Comedy Festival, and that same year she was a semi-finalist for the Andy Kaufman Award.  In 2013, she was a finalist at The Great American Comedy Festival. Her favorite thing about comedy is making friends.
