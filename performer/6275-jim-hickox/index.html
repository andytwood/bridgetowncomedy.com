As one of the founding members of the revered Denver troupe The Grawlix, Jim was pivotal in the rise of the now revered Denver comedy scene.  No matter the show, Jim always leaves an impression with his quick wit and inventive approach to stand-up; audiences have never seen anything like it. The integration of his laptop into his act gives him unprecedented access to innovate and explore comedy, both the old tropes and the avant-garde. It&#039;s as funny as it is ingenious.  Jim is a headliner at Comedy Works in Denver and works around the country. In 2012 he performed for a month at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. Most recently he performed at the inaugural High Plains Comedy Festival in Denver.

He is unrepresented, and really needs something cool to happen soon.
