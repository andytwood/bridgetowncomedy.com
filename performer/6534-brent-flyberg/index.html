Brent Flyberg wanted his bio to just to be a picture of a wallaroo eating a chocolate chip pancake off a chandelier, but he only gets what he wants occasionally, which makes him an okay guy to be around. He has candy in his pockets almost all the time, and if you ask nicely, he&#039;ll share. His comedy will make you feel good that you&#039;re not him. He has performed at Bumbershoot, Summer Meltdown, and the Melbourne International Comedy Festival. He hates wearing pants.
