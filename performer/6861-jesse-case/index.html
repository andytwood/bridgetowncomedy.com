Jesse Case (1986-2053) was a well known professional comedian and amateur geneticist from Nashville, Tennessee. The son of a songwriter and a doctor, Case grew up with a love of word-play and bodily functions. In 2008 he appeared on then popular television series, “Last Comic Standing.” Shortly after, he won the Rocky Mountain Laugh-Off, and continued to tour around America. His comedy has been described by the press as "hilariously dark," with such highlights in print as "had me in tears from beginning to end" and "not for me. He doesn't do it right." In early 2010, he launched a podcast, "The Last Resort with Jesse Case," the first radio show in history to feature a robot co-host. Later that year he appeared at the Just For Laughs Comedy Festival in Montreal to rave reviews. The following Spring he became the first man to successfully breed a pig and a head of lettuce, which gave birth to a baby Chef's Salad. He is survived by 7 wives, 19 children, and 1 grandson, who is also his nephew. He will be missed.
