Laura House is a comic and writer who first hit showbiz starring as herself on Mtv’s first fully-scripted sit-com, Austin Stories. This brought her from Texas to Hollywood where she played a hillbilly slut opposite Natalie Portman in the film Where the Heart is and stretched her acting chops as a planet of burping robots on Futurama. As a stand-up, she stood out in HBO’s Aspen Comedy Festival and had her network comic premiere in their Best of the Fest, which led to spots on Comedy Central, HBO, and NBC. She has written on shows including Blue Collar TV, the George Lopez Show, the Emmy-winning Samantha Who? and most recently the hit CBS show Mom. She’s had several shows in development including SuperMom at ABC with Barry Sonnenfeld, and LifeBlowz at Fx with Katey Sagal. She’s an LA favorite at stand-up and storytelling shows, teaches meditation and is a certified raw food chef who refuses to stop eating chocolate cake.
