Jen Seaman brings to the stage an imaginatively whimsical and sometimes dark (well, let’s be honest, most of the time dark) style of humor for over seven years now. Seaman has performed at a variety of festivals including SF Sketchfest, Bumbershoot (Seattle), She-Devil Comedy Festival (New York), and the Women in Comedy Festival (Boston). 

She was recently featured on FOX&quot;s Laughs and was a judge’s favorite on Season 6 of NBC’s America’s Got Talent, which took her to Vegas. Seaman can been seen on Comedy Central’s AtomTV and was recently named Seattle’s Best Comedian by Seattle Weekly.

Her bizarre upbringing, tales of a baby-obsessed mother and an unwavering desire to stay independent all play a part in making this sweet 5’1’’ spitfire one of the most unique stand-up comedians around!

When not on stage or writing Seaman can be found indulging in her other passion, baking, for her web series, “The Filling is Mutual.” “The Filling is Mutual” is a unique combination of sweets and laughs in which she and a fellow comedian use jokes as an inspiration for the creation of delicious treats.
