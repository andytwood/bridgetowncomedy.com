Jessica Sele is a deeply weird human being and stand-up comedian living in Oakland, CA. She frequently performs up and down the west coast and sometimes in Fargo. Jessica co-produces a popular weekly show every Thursday in San Francisco in the Cine Cave at Lost Weekend Video called the Mission Position and can also be seen at the San Francisco Punchline, or at most other regular comedy shows in the bay area. She has also performed in venues such as The Great American Music Hall, The Oakland Metropolitan Opera House and The Chapel. Her subject material ranges from sexuality to living in the end times to mental health issues and their related substance abuse habits, etc… Jessica’s comedy is often described as personal, emotionally raw, incisive and hilarious.
