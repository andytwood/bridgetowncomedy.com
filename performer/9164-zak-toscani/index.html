Zak is a stand-up comedian who lives in Portland, OR. He has performed at the Bumbershoot Music &amp; Arts Festival, San Francisco Sketchfest and the Bridgetown Comedy Festival. You may have also seen him perform at Helium Comedy Club, Go Bananas, the Tacoma Comedy Club, and Seattle&#039;s Comedy Underground as well as other stages both intimate and large.

In the three short years he has been performing he has lucky enough to share the stage with Jon Dore, Kyle Kinane, Pete Holmes, and TJ Miller to name a few. His style melts like an artisan cheese into both the honest and the silly, much like Dom DeLuise&#039;s lasagna recipe.
