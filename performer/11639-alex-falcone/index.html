Alex Falcone is a comedian and writer of average height living in Portland, OR. He was named one of the Funniest Five by the Willamette Week, Portland&#039;s Jimmy Kimmel by Oregonian, and his show Earthquake Hurricane was the Willamette Week&#039;s pick for best comedy show in the city. He&#039;s also the creator and host of the live talk show Late Night Action w/ Alex Falcone and the surprisingly popular podcast Read it and Weep, in which people pay him to suffer through bad books and movies. One time he was on the IFC show Portlandia and he still gets emails about it.

He&#039;s performed at the The Meltdown w/ Jonah and Kumail and Hot Tub Show w/ Kurt and Kristin in Los Angeles plus The Brooklyn Comedy Festival, Bumbershoot in Seattle, Sketchfest in San Francisco, and Hell Yes Fest in New Orleans.

Despite these modest accomplishments, he somehow remains totally down to earth and dresses in an approachable manner.
