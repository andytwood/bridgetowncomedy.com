Andy Kindler is known in comedy circles as a troublemaker.  Originally from New York, and now complaining from California, he annoys people all over the world.  Andy is a frequent guest and correspondent for The Late Show with David Letterman.  Each summer at the Just For Laughs Festival in Montreal he delivers the State of the Industry address to a packed ballroom filled with comics and Hollywood industry types.  He is infamous for his scathing attacks on the world of entertainment, including the previously taboo practice of making fun of his fellow comedians. Andy currently recurs on Comedy Central’s Tosh.0, IFC’s Maron and Fox’s hit animation, Bob’s Burgers.
