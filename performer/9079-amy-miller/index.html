Amy Miller gets on stage to tell jokes, and you’re all like, well she doesn’t look funny at ALL. I hope she doesn’t blow this! Maybe I should go for a smoke break.  Two minutes in, your pants have been charmed off by her rosy cheeks and the fact that she sounds like a six-year-old Asian boy. Five minutes in, you start to feel sad for her and sometimes feel the need to go, “AWWW” out loud in the middle of her set, or occasionally, “YOU’RE ADORABLE.” Ten minutes in, you’re not sure if you want to have wild sex with her or have her pretend to be your mom and tuck you into bed at night while lightly stroking your hair and singing, &quot;You Are My Sunshine&quot; because she’s also an excellent singer. Any exposure above 15 minutes, and your head is just a chaotic swirl of love feelings and a crippling fear of eventual heartbreak and rejection at the end of which you decide you should just be best friends. It’s fun!

Voted Portland’s Funniest Comedian by the Willamette Week in 2013, Amy Miller has been seen at the San Francisco Sketchfest, Noise Pop Festival, SF Punchline, Cobb’s Comedy Club, Harvey’s Comedy Club, Portland Helium Comedy Club, The All Jane No Dick Festival, The Siren Nation Festival, Laugh Your Asheville Off, Mississippi Studios Portland, and in the Bridgetown Comedy Festival. 

She has a podcast called Sorry About Your Dad. It’s about dad stuff.
