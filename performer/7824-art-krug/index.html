Art Krug is an enigma, which is defined in the dictionary as: “a German built enciphering machine made for commercial use and later adapted for military use”. He is also a very funny comedian. Art Krug also writes about himself in the third person…like now for instance. He has appeared on television (Showtime, commercials), comedy club and college stages, boats, buses, and picnic tables since the ’80s. And people keep asking him back. So that’s good.
