During Auggie’s set, pop culture and political targets are dissected piece by piece into intelligently written manic rants. His seamless rapid fire style has developed a loyal following across the country. He has spent most of the last two decades keeping a constant road schedule honing his craft and creating a truly memorable, relevant, and constantly evolving live experience.
