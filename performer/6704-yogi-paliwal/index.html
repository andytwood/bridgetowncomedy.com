A standup comedian based out of Seattle,Yogi Paliwal has performed around the country at comedy clubs, theaters and festivals including the San Francisco and Seattle Sketch Fest, The Bridgetown Comedy Festival, and at the NBC Standup for diversity Showcase in Seattle. He’s written for IGN and Frank and Funny greeting cards.

Carl Warmenhoven the manager of the Comedy Underground has said, “He has a youthness about him.” He enjoys the simple things in life, a grilled cheese sandwich, Bob Ross, whittling, and he gets bored writing his own bio.

If you were to ask Yogi how he would describe his comedy, he would say it’s “Intellectual absurdity.” If you asked him what that means he would say, “My material isn’t smart, but you need to be smart to see how stupid the joke is.”
