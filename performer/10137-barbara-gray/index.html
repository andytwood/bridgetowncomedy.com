Barbara Gray is a comedian and writer and maybe sometimes actress based out of Los Angeles. She has toured the country doing standup and has performed at comedy festivals like Bridgetown, SF Sketchfest, Limestone Comedy Fest, and has headlined the SLC Comedy Carnivale. She has been a writer for &quot;Billy on the Street&quot; on FUSE, and her comedy has been featured on Ellen, The Huffington Post, and America Online, also known as AOL. Her standup can be heard on the &quot;Holy Fuck&quot; live album, and she will be recording her own album later this year titled &quot;Family And Friends,&quot; featuring a disc of &#039;family-friendly&#039; material and a disc of &#039;not-so-family-friendly&#039; material. 

Barbara is one-third of the popular &quot;Lady to Lady&quot; podcast on the Maximum Fun network, along with comedians Tess Barker and Brandie Posey. Each week, the ladies welcome a fourth funny female to the table to discuss pop culture, embarrassing personal revelations, and everything in between. &quot;Lady to Lady&quot; can also be seen at the brand new UCB Sunset with live shows that continue to frighten and blow minds.
