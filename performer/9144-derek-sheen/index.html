Derek Sheen is a cuddly mess of insecurities and is quickly becoming a favorite among comedy nerds all over the globe! He’s been a featured performer at the Cape Fear and S.F. Sketchfest Comedy Festivals,  has toured with Patton Oswalt, Brian Posehn, Janeane Garofolo and Rory Scovel! His debut album “Holy Drivel” was recorded by iconic metal producer Matt Bayles (Minus the Bear, Mastodon, Isis).

Lindy West (GQ Magazine) has called him “A Human Hug.”

PASTE Magazine: “Derek Sheen has the uncanny ability to take mundane events and turn them into over-the-top comedy.&quot;

“Dylan Gadino at Laughspin Magazine: “Equal parts-playful-and-absurd approach to self-deprecating comedy.”

Daniel Berkowitz of TheSpitTake-Comedynews.org: “When Sheen’s at his best, he’s firing everything off with nuanced diction and rhythmical precision. He develops a Carlin-esque pace to his speech that only serves to amplify the already-high level of laughs.”
