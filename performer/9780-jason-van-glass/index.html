Master of the one-liner, and favorite comedian of servicemen and presidents alike, Jason Van Glass is one of the nation&#039;s most-beloved entertainers, a millionaire many times over, and a star in every category open to him -- vaudeville, radio, television and film, most notably a string of &quot;Road&quot; movies with longtime friend Bing Crosby. He performs regularly at clubs around Los Angeles including the Meltdown, the Comedy Store, and the Pasadena Icehouse, and has traveled countless miles to entertain troops in cities like Austin, Portland, Santa Cruz, San Luis Obispo, San Diego, San Francisco, and Fresno. The Bob Hope American Patriot Award is named in his honor.
