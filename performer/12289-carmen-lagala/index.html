Carmen Lagala began doing comedy in her hometown in the state of Vermont. She tours with The Vermont Comedy Divas and it&#039;s charitable branch, &quot;Divas Do Good&quot;, which performs to raise money for human-service non-profit organizations. While in Vermont, she placed first in the Higher Ground Comedy Battle, was a finalist in Vermont&#039;s Funniest Contest, performed in Boston&#039;s Women in Comedy Festival, has been a feature performer in the Green Mountain Comedy Festival and has performed several times at the new state-of-the-art Vermont Comedy Club.

Since moving to New York City in 2014 Carmen has become a rising presence, hosting and headlining for the Devil Cup, She-Devil, and Laughing Devil festivals, and performing at beloved venues such The Creek and the Cave, UCBEast, and the Knitting Factory.

She hosts two monthly comedy shows in New York City, &quot;Creek Bros&quot; and &quot;Wigging Out with Carmen.&quot;
