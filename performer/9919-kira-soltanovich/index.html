Kira Soltanovich grew up in San Francisco during a time when there were bad neighborhoods, cheap coffee and it wasn’t ironic to ride the cable cars. She began her career in comedy back in 1998 right after asking her immigrant Russian parents if they were supportive of her desire to become a stand up comedian. After her mother and father confessed “It’s not like you’re smart enough to be a doctor” Kira took that as their blessing to pursue her dreams and she’s never looked back.

 

She was a series regular on the hidden camera show Girls Behaving Badly for 4 seasons, and was a correspondent on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno for over 8 years.

 

Kira has appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live, Last Call with Carson Daly, Hell’s Kitchen, Last Comic Standing, Set List TV, Nick Mom, Hello Ross! and The World Stands Up. She has written and performed with Joan Rivers, Scott Baio, Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber. And if that doesn’t impress you, I don’t know what will.

She’s been a writer on How’d You Get So Rich? for TV Land, Raising Whitley on Oxygen and Prankstars on Disney.  Currently Kira is a Series Regular on How To Be A Grownup for TruTV.

 

Her half hour Showtime special, Here Comes Trouble, won Best Stand Up Special by a Soviet.*

 

Kira’s four year old son inspired her to have her very own podcast. On The Kira Soltanovich Show, Kira interviews other fellow comedians who have kids and they discuss all things comedy and colic related.
