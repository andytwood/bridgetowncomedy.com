Derek Smith is a stand up comic originally from Oklahoma, now living in Chicago.  He was a part of the 2013 Just For Laughs Festival in Chicago, and is a cast member of The Lincoln Lodge.

Despite being a bag of vices and complaints, he remains likable and lovable, like a smart, irritated teddy bear who makes poor life decisions. He’s been described as disgusting and smart. He could probably write this generation’s definitive dick joke in his sleep. He probably will, but only in between being a hundred kinds of funny, intelligent, and captivating.
