Originally from Chicago, Tony is probably the only comedian who can say they were published in Nature Medicine. Schooled in Molecular/Marine Biology, one day Tony put down the micropipette and picked up a microphone and began slinging jokes.

Since turning in his lab coat, he’s written and produced on several shows including MTV’s &quot;Ridiculousness,&quot; A&amp;E’s show &quot;Brandi and Jarrod: Married to the Job,&quot; CNBC’s &quot;Jay Leno’s Garage,&quot; and A&amp;E’s &quot;Storage Wars: Barry Strikes Back.&quot; He also created, developed and sold the web-series, &quot;Tornado: The Goldfish Sheriff&quot; to FreeMantle Media.

He’s also written for HAHAJK.com, MTV2’s Guy Code Blog, MTV News, Playboy, Smosh, TMZ and Ranker.com.

He’s been privileged to perform at prestigious comedy festivals all over the country like Seattle’s Bumbershoot, RIOT LA, JFL – Chicago, Bridgetown (2014, 2012, 2011, 2010), NY Underground Comedy Festival, NY Fringe, and more.

His debut comedy album, “Scaredy Cat,” with Stand Up! Records was featured on iTunes as &quot;New and Noteworthy&quot; and heralded by Huffington Post.
