Rana May’s deadpan delivery and punk rock sensibility make her comedy different than anything you might have seen before. She has a self-proclaimed issue with authority – but loves dogs – which is why she is so ambivalent about police dogs. Something she loves and hates wrapped up in such a medium fluffy package.

Rana has been featured locally in the City Pages and on Minnesota Public Radio. You can see her performing all over the Twin Cities producing and hosting shows under the Kill It! moniker (open mic, comedy-oke, and open mic brunch). You could also catch her reading at the long running Riot Act Reading Series, the Irregular Reading Series, at the Loft Literary Center or doing comedy on various club stages. She’s has opened for national headliners such as Mary Mack, Tim Harmston, and Neil Hamburger.

Rana is the winner of Rick Bronson’s House of Comedy 2014 Funniest Person with a Day Job Contest.
