Ismael Loutfi is a sweet boy. Just look at that face. You probably want to bring him home to mom. Underneath that sweetness lies a deeply acerbic sense of humor, the sort of thing you might develop growing up a Muslim in Ocala, Fl. Now living in Atlanta, GA Ismael has quickly become a favorite of the city’s exploding comedy scene. He’s a regular at the Laughing Skull Lounge and Atlanta Improv, and has been featured on The Fest in Gainesville alongside Chris Gethard.
