Dan Harmon serves as creator/executive producer of the comedy series “Community.”

Harmon’s pursuit of minimal work for maximum reward took him from stand-up to improv to sketch comedy, then finally to Los Angeles, where he began writing feature screenplays. His first deal was with Robert Zemeckis at Imagemovers, for whom he co-wrote “Monster House.” Along with his writing partner Rob Schrab, Harmon went on to write the Ben Stiller-directed pilot “Heat Vision and Jack,” starring Jack Black and Owen Wilson.

Disillusioned by the legitimate industry, Harmon retreated underground, during which time he attended classes at nearby Glendale Community College. It was also during this time that Harmon co-founded Channel 101, an untelevised non-profit audience-controlled network for undiscovered filmmakers, many of whom used it to launch mainstream careers, including the boys behind SNL’s Digital Shorts. Harmon and Schrab then partnered with Sarah Silverman to create her series for Comedy Central, “The Sarah Silverman Program,” where he served as the head writer for several episodes.

Harmon then created, wrote and performed in the VH1 sketch series “Acceptable TV.” As part of a blind deal with Sony and inspired by his experience as a community college student, Harmon created “Community” which marked his first network series. Harmon is also the co-creator of the animated Adult Swim series “Rick &amp; Morty.”
