Hailing from Memphis, TN, Nick Cobb attended Indiana University where he majored in Psychology and learned to obsess over meaningless nonsense. This led him to work in his first comedy club, aptly named “The Looney Bin.”  It was at a tiny Beale Street bar where Nick won a stand-up competition, was bitten by the comedy bug and moved to New York to pursue The Dream.  While in New York, Nick was seen on Comedy Central’s &quot;Live at Gotham,&quot; VH1’s &quot;Morning Buzz,&quot; AMC’s &quot;Date Night&quot; as well as on NBC’s “Last Comic Standing” where he not only earned a spot in the semi-finals, but was also featured in a montage of comics recognized for having highly original material.  Less than a year ago, Nick took his talents to Los Angeles.  Since moving out West he won the March Madness Competition at the Hollywood Improv, appeared on Comedy Central’s &quot;Inside Amy Schumer,&quot; and had his late night debut on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson.  He also recently performed on AXS’s Gotham Comedy Live.  He also played the lead in the espn.com comedic web series “Team Players,” and has been seen in many commercials including Pepsi Max, Asthma.com, Joe’s Crab Shack, Carmax and starred in an e*Trade spot during halftime of the Super Bowl!  When not performing standup, Nick is brooding over that one guy in the crowd who was texting during his act.
