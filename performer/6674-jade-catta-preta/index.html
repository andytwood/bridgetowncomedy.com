Jade Catta-Preta was one boney baby, born in Sao Paulo, Brazil, then later raised in Virginia to ensure a future in comedy. She travels the country featuring for Bill Burr, Bobby Lee and Kevin Nealon, and is a paid regular at The Comedy Store, The Improv and the Laugh Factory. She recently filmed an improvised FOX pilot directed by Dan Mazer and produced by Ron Howard as well as an eight episode arc for next season of Showtime&#039;s &quot;Californication.&quot; You can catch her along side Steve Rannazzisi in &quot;Daddy Knows Best&quot; and the upcoming season of Nuvo&#039;s &quot;Standup and Deliver.&quot; Like the 1995 David Caruso porno thriller of the same name, Jade takes herself very seriously.
