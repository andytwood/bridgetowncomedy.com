Dina Hashem first tried stand-up by auditioning for the 2010 New Jersey Comedy Festival at Rutgers University. After winning 1st place, she continued to pursue comedy and has since been performing regularly at clubs including Broadway Comedy Club, Caroline&#039;s, The Laughing Devil, Comic Strip Live, and The Stress Factory.

Dina&#039;s memorable style contrasts a subtle delivery with witty observations and dark musings on her cultural upbringing. She was a semi-finalist in the She-Devil Comedy Festival and Laughing Devil Comedy Festival, and a participant of Gilda&#039;s Laugh Fest and the Jersey City Comedy Festival. Her writing has also been featured on the websites of Comedy Central and Nickelodeon.
