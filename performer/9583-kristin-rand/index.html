In her four short years in Denver, comic Kristin Rand has made quite the impression on the city. The Denver Post has called her “one of the most gloriously authentic, irrepressible personalities in the city” and listed her a comic to watch at the 2012 Laugh Track Comedy Festival. In 2013, she was listed in Reverb as one of the top 10 comics to watch at the inaugural High Plains Comedy Festival. Rand is a four-time semi-finalist in the prestigious annual Comedy Works New Faces Contest. The Denver Westward has called Kristin a &quot;sentient cupcake&quot; and “endlessly charming” . In addition to stand-up comedy, she writes and performs sketch regularly which has garnered press from the Denver Post. A frequent collaborator with the Nix Brothers, Rand is also featured in many Nix Bros videos. In 2013, she was awarded &quot;best actress&quot; for the Nix Bros film &quot;Love to Hate&quot;.  

In 2014, Rand served as a host to 5 monthly showcases, 4 of which she produced herself. She is a regular at both the Denver Comedy Works and the Denver Improv where she has worked with such acts as Ron Funches, Baron Vaughn, Moshe Kasher, and Nick Thune. During the 2014 High Plains Comedy Festival, Rand won her round of Competitive Erotic Fan Fiction and served as the MC for the festival&#039;s grand finale show featuring acts like Beth Stelling, Billy Wayne Davis, and Pete Holmes. 

In late 2014, Rand was crowned the Moth StorySlam champion at the Denver debut of the Moth StorySlam. Since her win, she has been serving as a recurring host for the event.
