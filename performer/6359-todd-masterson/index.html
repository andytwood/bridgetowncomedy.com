Todd Masterson is a writer and comedian who lives with his tiny husband (Todd is 6&#039;7&quot; and his husband is 5&#039;4&quot;) and their little black pug in West Hollywood, CA. Todd is best known as one of the nine writers that went on strike from Fashion Police with Joan Rivers last year. He&#039;s also appeared on Arsenio, as well as written for the Roast of James Franco. Todd produces a monthly show called All That Could Have Been, for writers to read the submission packets they&#039;ve written for shows, but never got the job. He&#039;s opened for Jimmy Fallon on the college circuit and appears all around Los Angeles in several popular shows.
