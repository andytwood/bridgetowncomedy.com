Originally from Seattle, Barbara Holm has performed at the San Francisco Sketchfest, the Bridgetown Comedy Festival, Bumbershoot Arts festival, and the Women in Comedy Festival in Boston. She has written for IGN, The Portland Mercury, Hahajk, and the Huffington Post. She has been awarded Time Out New York’s Joke of the Week and was named “one of the best things about comedy in 2012″ by the Comedy Bureau. Barbara writes a weekly humor column for The Portland Mercury about social injustice called, &quot;Don&#039;t be a Dick.&quot; 

Her comedy has been described as clever, unique, idiosyncratic, and exuberant. Seattle City Arts Magazine called her a “comedy wizard,” The Seattle Stranger newspaper called her an “adorable wunderkind,” and The Portland Mercury described her as a &quot;joke machine.&quot; She describes herself as, “running away from this question to hide under the desk right now.&quot;
