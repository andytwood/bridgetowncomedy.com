Curtis Cook is a comic from Cleveland, Ohio now living in Portland, Oregon. He has performed in venues and festivals throughout the country, including Cleveland’s Accidental Comedy Festival, the Chicago Comedy Exposition, and San Francisco’s Sketchfest. 

The Portland Mercury described Curtis’ comedy as “sleepy, slam poetry,” and the Willamette Week lists him as among Portland’s funniest comics. 

In addition to performing stand-up, Curtis has been featured on Daily VICE and appeared on television programs in Kenya, Sierra Leone, and throughout the Middle East. He also co-hosts Earthquake Hurricane, a superlative comedy show every Wednesday night in PDX.
