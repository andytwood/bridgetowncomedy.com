Young, fresh, full of life and Totino&#039;s pizza, Tim Hammer&#039;s style revolves around one-liners. Audience members often share his one-liners with their friends, and possibly enemies.

In 2013, Tim performed at Bridgetown Comedy Festival, was a finalist in the Portland&#039;s Funniest Person Contest, and then a finalist in the Big Sky International Comedy Competition. He has performed at venues such as the Hollywood Improv, Helium Comedy Club, Seattle Comedy Underground, and Applebee&#039;s. 

In 2014, he performed at a Denny&#039;s.

He does not lip-sync any of his material.
