Opeyemi &quot;Ope&quot; Olagbaju may be a young comic, but his love and commitment to stand up can always be seen on stage.  The OC/LAcomic. has been seen performing at various clubs(Irvine Improv, Ontario Improv, Brea improv, Spectacles Theater, Flappers) and colleges(UCSB, UCFC) throughout southern California.. Ope has  been noted for his observational humor and being able to craft hilarity from his own personal experiences of being an immigrant who assimilated into American culture and society. Through comedy Ope wants like to explore what makes us different and more importantly how these differences make us all the same.  His philosophy is that &quot;No matter where you&#039;re from, finding a way to laugh is a highly important component of the human experience and something we can all relate to. I&#039;m just glad I have been given the opportunity to make people laugh and share in that experience &quot;
