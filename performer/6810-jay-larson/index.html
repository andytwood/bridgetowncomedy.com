Jay Larson is a stand up comedian and writer.  BORING! No but he&#039;s really funny guys, come on, listen!  Jay&#039;s unique perspective and original voice have been Jay&#039;s calling card since doing the prestigious Montreal Comedy Festival in 2005.  Since then he has been a regular at Bridgetown Comedy Festival, had his own half hour special on Comedy Central, performed at SXSW, and has made 5 Late night appearances.  While most people see stand up comedians as Joke tellers, Jay sees himself as more of a storyteller.  He cemented himself as a storyteller by performing one single story on Conan in 2013.  The response was amazing and the YouTube video of the set went viral.  Jay attributes his storytelling success to his extremely popular podcast, The CrabFeast.  This conversational storytelling podcast has a cult following that grows weekly.  Released every Toozdee at TheCrabFeast.com, Jay&#039;s podcast has featured some of comedy&#039;s best story tellers and comics.  He is currently in development with NBC Universal Studios, and hopes to put his storytelling onto the silver screen so he never has to prove himself through a BIO again.
