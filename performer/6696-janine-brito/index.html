JANINE BRITO is a stand up comic, and was a writer and on-air correspondent on the critically acclaimed FX series, Totally Biased with W. Kamau Bell, produced by Chris Rock. 

Janine started doing standup comedy in St. Louis and has performed at clubs and theaters throughout the US and Hong Kong. She is the winner of the 2009 SF Women&#039;s Comedy Competition, and recipient of Rooftop Comedy&#039;s 2010 Silver Nail Award. Praised by 7x7 Magazine as &quot;one of SF&#039;s more daring voices&quot; and one of &quot;the 7 funniest people in town,&quot; she was named the 2011 “Best Comedian with a Message” by the East Bay Express. Her recent festival appearances include Sketchfest, the Bridgetown Comedy Festival and the Glasgow International Comedy Festival.

W. Kamau Bell calls her “a sarcastic, snarky smart bomb of comedy funk straight from the 80&#039;s,” and the SF Weekly says she’s “a mean lesbian,” but she’s pretty sure that they mean it in a good way.
