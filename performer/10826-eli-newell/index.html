Eli Newell was raised by friendly giants in Oregon. He moved to the east coast to study at Wesleyan University in CT and then headed down the road to New York City where he spent ten years performing on a whole mess of teams at UCBNY and on the road with the UCBTourCo. On TV, Eli's notable credits include Late Night with Conan O'Brien, Jimmy Kimmel Live, Best Week Ever, Adult Swim's Delocated, Key &amp; Peele, both Children's Hospital AND General Hospital - as well as a bunch of commercials and a handful of pilots that nobody will ever see. 

Eli is a world traveler with forty-five countries and five continents under his belt. He recently hosted an online travel show called Donâ€™t Kill Eli in which viewer votes dictated his itinerary through six countries in the Middle East and North Africa. The highlight of Eli's year is emceeing the Firecracker Wiener Nationals every Fourth of July up in Rockaway Beach, Oregon. You've probably heard of it if you're a wiener dog.
