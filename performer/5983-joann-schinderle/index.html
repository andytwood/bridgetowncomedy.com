JoAnn Schinderle hails from the upper Midwest and despite being a Portlander now, will probably never lose her “hot dish” accent. (Hotdish ingredients include but are not limited to: ground beef, canned vegetables, canned soup, cheese, and tater tots.) For the past year,  JoAnn has been making strides in Portland’s thriving comedy scene by way of stand-up and improv. Recently performing in the All Jane No Dick comedy festival and 2014&#039;s SF Sketchfest, as a stand-up her humor is relatable, snarky, and has a storytelling style that will make you feel like she’s your best friend letting you in on a secret. As an improviser and member of the Curious Comedy House Team ensemble, she creates big characters and will “yes and” the shit out of you. JoAnn’s performed both mediums at venues in Chicago (Second City Training Center) and all around Portland (Curious Comedy Theater, Brody Theater, and Funhouse Lounge.)
