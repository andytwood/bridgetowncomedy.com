&quot;Offbeat,&quot; &quot;unexpected&quot; and &quot;clever&quot; are just three of literally hundreds of words used to describe the comedy-style stylings of Steven Wilber. Since starting stand-up in 2011, Steven has risen up in the Portland comedy scene to become a frequent performer at arcade bars, anarchist bookstores, Doctor Who-themed seafood restaurants and other typical comedy venues this city has to offer. In 2014, he had the honor of winning Portlandâ€™s Funniest Person competition, as well as being voted in the Willamette Week&#039;s &quot;Funniest Five&quot; list.

Steven has also performed at the Bridgetown Comedy Festival, SF Sketchfest, Bumbershoot, and has been featured on Bryan Cook&#039;s Competitive Erotic Fan Fiction podcast.
