Nathan was the winner of the Seattle International Comedy Competition in 2014, voted in Willamette Week&#039;s &quot;Portland&#039;s Funniest 5&quot; for 2013, and released his first comedy album &quot;I Black Out&quot; that same year. On top of that, he was the winner of Helium Comedy Club’s “Portland’s Funniest Person Comedy Competition” in 2012. Nathan has opened for national headliners such as Dave Chappelle, Damon Wayans, Maria Bamford, and has Photoshopped himself into photos with many more. The back of Nathan&#039;s head was seen in NBC’s new series, “Grimm”. Nathan is now seeking a funnier way to end this paragraph.
