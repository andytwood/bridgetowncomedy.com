Matt Ingebretson is a writer and comedian. He performs all over LA and was featured on the standup compilation album, &quot;Holy Fuck.&quot; He has written for the Soup, the Onion, Funny or Die, and MTV. Also, he&#039;s worried his bio is too short so he tacked on this sentence to make it seem more substantial.
