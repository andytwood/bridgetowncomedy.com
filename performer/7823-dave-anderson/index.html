A nationally touring comedian, Dave Anderson has performed at the country’s premier comedy clubs, including the world famous Improv in Los Angeles. He has appeared on numerous television shows such as: “Star Search,” Showtime’s “Comedy Club Network,” and “An Evening at the Improv.” His comedy is heard around the world on Sirius and XM satellite radio. Most recently Dave was a contributing writer for the “Tonight Show with Jay Leno.”

Dave is currently an Emmy award winning co-host of the long running morning television talk show “AM Northwest” on KATU TV and co- host of the  ”Mark and Dave Show” on AM 860 KPAM radio in Portland.

Dave’s unique ability to blend clean, intelligent material with audience interaction has made him a favorite at corporate events and college campuses across America.

The audience plays a major role in Dave’s show. He has an amazing ability to turn ordinary conversations into hilarious comedy routines while remaining clean and inoffensive. The Oregonian dubbed him “The quickest wit around.” The San Francisco Examiner said he was, “relaxed, likeable, and funny . . .” Willamette Week said, “He ad- libs better than most comedians write.” Because of his quick wit and audience rapport, no two shows are ever exactly alike.
