Curtis Cook is a comic from Cleveland, Ohio now living in Portland, Oregon. He has performed in venues and festivals throughout the country, including the Cleveland Comedy Festival, the Chicago Comedy Exposition, the Big Sky Comedy Festival, and San Francisco’s Sketchfest.

In addition to performing, Curtis is among the co-hosts of Earthquake Hurricane – a weekly comedy showcase described as one of the best in Portland – and co-hosts a semi-kinda-biweekly podcast titled Black By Popular Demand. He is also a contributing writer for Laugh Staff, and presently holds an undisputed record for 2014’s highest number of consecutive tweets about the 4 Non Blondes.

The Portland Mercury described his comedy as “sleepy, slam poetry,” and the Willamette Week listed him among 2014&#039;s funniest five comics in PDX.
