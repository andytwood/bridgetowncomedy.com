Peggy O&#039;Leary is a stand up comedian based out of New York, but comes from the burbs of Philly, and thats very important for you to know.  Peggy tells jokes and stories about her fat girl past, her &quot;My Girl&quot; upbringing (minus the bee stings), and being completely weirded out about men and sex.  She performed at The Women in Comedy Festival in Boston and The Jersey City Comedy Festival, both in 2013. 

Her sketch group BLEAK! Comedy has performed all over the east coast, was featured at the Austin Sketch Festival, The National Comedy College Festival and performed BLEAK! Comedy: STOMACHTOWN at the UCB theatre in NYC.  Her stand up can be seen all over NYC at The Creek and The Cave, UCBTheatre, EastVille Comedy Club, The Village Lantern, and many bars and apartments all over the outer boroughs.
