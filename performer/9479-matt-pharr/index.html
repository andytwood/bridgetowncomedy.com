For the past ten years Atlanta-born comedian Matt Pharr has been honing his stand-up skills around the south and up the east coast. Getting his start in rockabilly/punk rock clubs, it&#039;s not surprising that hints of the southern outlaw spirit shine through in his performances. Matt&#039;s sense of humor and rebellious nature came together when he and his friends opened an illegal comedy club/speakeasy in an abandoned church in Atlanta, paying off local law enforcement, and bringing in some of the best comics in the country to perform.  

With Matt&#039;s easygoing demeanor, he tackles divisive topics such as police brutality, abortion, and drugs in a way that allows the audience to laugh regardless of their stance on an issue. It&#039;s not all heavy topics, though. Matt stacks the deck by alternating between silly and important subject matter. It&#039;s not at all uncommon for a bit about police murdering an unarmed person to be followed by a joke about how the city of Dubai should add the prefix &quot;shooby&quot; to its name. 

Although raised in poverty by a single mother, Matt feels as though he has had some advantages, especially when it comes to comedy. &quot;When your mom has a drinking problem and your dad did some stints in mental institutions, there&#039;s a pretty fine chance that you&#039;re going to be funnier than most people,&quot; he says. 

On his recent move to Los Angeles: &quot;I rode across the country, bringing with me my only possessions: a motorcycle, some T-shirts, a gun, and one bullet. Sometimes, when you follow your dreams, you end up with a motorcycle, some T-shirts, a gun, and one bullet.&quot;
