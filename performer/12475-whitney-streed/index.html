Whitney Streed is a comedian because if they were not, their incessant punning would have no artistic or monetary value whatsoever. Whitney performs stand-up in and around the Pacific Northwest and has featured for Maria Bamford, Rob Delaney, Jackie Kashian, and other rad individuals. Festival appearances include Seattle Sketchfest, Bumbershoot, Salt Lake City Comedy Carnivale, and All Jane Comedy Festival in Portland. Whitney has also been a part of Portland's Bridgetown Comedy Festival as a performer, a volunteer, and, since 2013, a producer. They can be seen hosting shows around Portland including the superfun comedy game show "Rants Off/ Dance Off."
