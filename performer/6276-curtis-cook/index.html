Curtis Cook is a comic from Cleveland, Ohio now living in Portland, Oregon.  He has performed in venues and festivals throughout the country, including the Cleveland Comedy Festival, Salt Lake City’s Comedy Carnivale, Bridgetown Comedy Festival, and San Francisco’s Sketchfest.

Curtis doesn’t like a lot of things, and has been referred to as a “charming nihilist,” “the physical embodiment of insecurity,” and, “an existential crisis on stage.”  Those are almost nice things to say about a person. 

You can follow him on twitter at @Curtis_Cook.
