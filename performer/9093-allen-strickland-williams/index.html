I was born in Texas, grew up in Florida and went to college in New York. Now I live in Los Angeles writing and telling one-liners. I made my late-night television debut performing stand-up on CONAN this past Fall. I’ve performed at the Hollywood Improv, The Comedy Store, Denver’s Comedy Works and The Punchline in San Francisco. One time, I got a standing ovation for telling a single joke. I’m featured on the Holy Fuck. live comedy album. Buy it. It’s great. I’ve traveled to perform at Fest in Florida, Comedy Carnivale in Salt Lake City and Hell Yes Fest! in New Orleans. I’ve also been on the RIOT Festival in Los Angeles. I am one-fourth of the sketch group WOMEN, which has been featured on Tosh.0 and at the top of L.A. Weekly’s 10 L.A. Comedy Acts to Watch in 2014. I feel compelled to end this bio on a joke, but I won’t.
