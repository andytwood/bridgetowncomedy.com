Originally from Oregon and now living in Los Angeles, Randy Liedtke was named one of Comedy Central's Comics to Watch in 2013. You may have seen him on IFC's Maron, Cartoon Network's Adventure Time, or heard his award winning podcast The Bone Zone that he co-hosts with Brendon Walsh.  Lou Dobbs said he is "beyond council".
