At the ripe young age of thirty-something, Portland comic Randy Mendez thought it&#039;d be the perfect time to go to college and to start a family. At the same time.

Some years later now he&#039;s about to graduate and he&#039;s almost fully taught his three-year-old daughter to yell &quot;Fart!&quot; in public spaces. After taking third in the search for Portland&#039;s Funnies Person, the Portland Mercury described Randy as having &quot;a disarming, ebullient stage presence that calls to mind listening to a slightly manic, very inappropriate friend share stories about his fucked-up day.&quot; Randy is way too happy about the wrong parts of that statement.

Randy has previously been seen at the Seattle International Comedy Competition, Helium Comedy Club, Funny Over Everything, They Mystery Box Show, No Pun Intendo, and many other shows that didn&#039;t pay well, but promised would look great in a bio.
