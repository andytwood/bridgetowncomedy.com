Rhea Butcher grew up in Akron, Ohio as a skateboarder and a printmaker. She moved to Chicago after a series of grad schools, and cut her teeth comically at The Second City and iO before eventually landing in standup. Rhea brings a James Dean type cool to her highly personal jokes. She has performed in clubs such as Zanies (Chicago), Comedy Works (Denver), The Jukebox (Peoria), and The Improv (LA); as well as alternative comedy instititions like Chicago Underground Comedy and The Lincoln Lodge (Chicago), The Meltdown, UCB (Los Angeles), Union Hall and The Bell House (Brooklyn). She was part of the 2013 Bridgetown Comedy Festival, Cleveland Accidental Comedy Festival, SF Sketchfest, and the first ever Atlantic Ocean Comedy &amp; Music Festival. 

You can also catch Rhea in Buzzfeed’s “Ask A Lesbian” webseries, live show/podcast Put Your Hands Together, and movie podcast Wham Bam Pow.
