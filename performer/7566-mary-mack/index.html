Folk humorist and comedian Mary Mack is a favorite on radio shows and podcasts around the country, including Marc Maron&#039;s WTF Podcast, The Bob and Tom Show, and American Public Media&#039;s WITS live show and podcast.  Her comedy (spotted with occasional mandolin or clarinet outbursts) has  been seen in the Vancouver Comedy Fest, The Andy Kaufman Awards, Montrealâ€™s Just For Laughs Festival, and the San Francisco Sketch Fest as one of &quot;The Dozen&quot; up and coming headliners designated by the festival.  She is a main voice on Fox&#039;s new late night ADHD cartoon &quot;Golan the Insatiable.&quot;  Mack divides her time among Los Angeles,  Minneapolis, and a camper in the woods in Northern Wisconsin.
