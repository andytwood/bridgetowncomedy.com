Ever&#039;s spontaneous characters, quick-witted anecdotes, and quirky mannerisms will have you laughing well after her performance.  Her background in improv gives her the ability to create visceral and borderline cathartic moments in her crowd work and off-the-cuff riffs.

She has worked with national headliners such as Ian Karmel, Jerrod Carmichael, Moshe Kasher, Maria Bamford, and Matt Braunger. 

Along with Louis C.K. and John Mulaney- Ever was listed as one of the Top Five Comics who could (successfully) tell a rape joke. 

Ever lives and works in Los Angeles, but she got her comedic start in Chicago where she was one of the city&#039;s best stand-ups and a cast member of the esteemed Chicago Underground Comedy.  She is also the co-founder/host/and producer of the multi-city show, The Shit Show.  Chicago Magazine credits her being one of the top 100 comics, Metromix/ Redeye says she&#039;s one of the Top Seven Acts to Watch in 2012, and Gaper&#039;s Block called her one of The Most Influential Women in Chicago Comedy.
