Called a “Gem” by RE:Com Chicago Comedy magazine, “Killing it” by the Chicago Tribune, and “Fearless” by ComedyofChicago.com, Sean White was just listed as one of the top 16 comics in Chicago by Chicago Magazine “with jokes that look misery straight in the eye” and has been performing over 8 years in clubs across 3 countries. His brutally honest style of quick thought-provoking material landed him in the finals of the Hong Kong International Comedy Competition with entrants from over 11 countries, and his debut album &quot;Dead and Gone&quot; was called “an essential rumination about loss” by the Chicago Tribune with “a point of view unique among comics.&quot; Originally from Alabama, Sean is now located in Chicago and can be seen in showcases, clubs, and family reunions throughout the Midwest and South.
