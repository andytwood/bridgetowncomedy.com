After being “discovered” at his bus stop in the 3rd grade, Brad Silnutzer became an international superstar (read: was in a series of Ovaltine commercials, that lead everyone to make fun of his for the next 20 years).  Now, ending his long hiatus from entertainment, Brad left his job as a high school teacher and became a Los Angeles-based stand up comedian.    

Brad performs every night at places ranging from coffee shops to The Hollywood Improv and produces some really neat LA shows: “Brew HaHa: The Comedy Show Drinkng Game”, “The Nickel Club”, “Thomas Time”, and “The Midnight Society”.  People have said of his comedy, &quot;those are some high energy stories&quot; and &quot;he&#039;s my son, but I don&#039;t get it&quot; .  He looks forward to eventually flaming out, and begging Ovaltine to do a retrospective commercial bringing back the boys from the past.
