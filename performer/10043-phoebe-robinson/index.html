Phoebe Robinson is a stand up comedian, writer, and actor who both TimeOut NY and Flavorpill have named one of the top ten comics working in NYC. Most recently, she appeared on Comedy Central’s Broad City, NBC’s Last Comic Standing and the Today show, and is a writer on MTV’s hit talking head show Girl Code.

When not working in television, Ms. Robinson is a writer for Glamour.com and contributes to The New York Times, bitch magazine, xoJane.com, VH1.com, Refinery 29.com, Decider.com, VanityFair.com, and TheDailyBeast.com. Her blog Blaria (aka Black Daria), which is rapidly approaching 150,000 views, has been featured on The Huffington Post, and has launched a podcast as well as a monthly stand up show at UCB East that she co-hosts with The Daily Show’s Jessica Williams and it has consistently sold out since its inception nearly a year ago.

She recently just finished opening for The Daily Show’s Wyatt Cenac and Broad City on their comedy tours and is currently a staff writer on Fuse’s upcoming daily late night pop culture talk show.
