Elicia Sanchez is a stand-up comedian, writer, comic book reader and mostly an adult who has been talking to strangers from stages all over the West Coast since 2010. Her self-deprecating, yet upbeat style has been described by The Capitol Hill Times as, "...mad cap tales of social incompetence," while writer/activist Lindy West has called her, "...a grumpy nugget of delight," and "...one of the funniest people in Seattle, for serious." 

Elicia has performed at Bumbershoot, the Bridgetown Comedy Festival, the All Jane No Dick Comedy Festival, GeekGirlCon, Northwest Comedy Fest, Autostraddle’s A-Camp and has opened for comedians W. Kamau Bell (Totally Biased w/ W. Kamau Bell), Wyatt Cenac (The Daily Show) and is a regular opening act for comedian Hari Kondabolu (Late Show with David Letterman).  She has made appearances on the Seattle-based sketch TV show "The [206]," KJR-FM's "The Bob Rivers Show," NPR's "Latino USA" and has written for websites Autostraddle, Capeless Crusader, Have You Nerd? and Jezebel. 

Elicia currently resides in Seattle, WA where when not performing stand-up or singing with her band Lightning Bolton (Seattle’s only all-female Michael Bolton comedy cover band) she enjoys splitting her time between drinking shots of wine, panic attacks on the bus and dusting her action figures.
