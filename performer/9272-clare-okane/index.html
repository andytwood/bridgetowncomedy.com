Clare O’Kane is an actress and comedian from San Jose, California. She has performed in the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, the Bridgetown Comedy Festival, SF Sketchfest, and other wonderful festivals around the country. She has been described as “sarcastic” and “half-Asian.” Along with being a stand up, Clare is also one-third of the sketch group Blessed. They have made a couple of very funny videos, none of which have gone viral. When she’s not sneezing or whatever, Clare travels around the country to perform stand-up comedy and “seize the day.” She hopes to get that tattooed on her lower back (for free) someday. She currently lives in Los Angeles, California with a guy and a cat.
