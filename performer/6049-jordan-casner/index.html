Originally from McMinnville, Oregon, Jordan Casner has been living and performing comedy in Portland for the last few years. His brand of comedy really isn&#039;t branded yet. But that&#039;s what people are into now, right? One thing that is certain is that his medium for performance is always changing. You might hear a song, you might hear some jokes, you might see him get choked to death in a horse mask. Jordan has performed at the Bridgetown Comedy Festival and has been a guest on shows like Funny Over Everything and The Spicy News.
