Reggie Watts is an internationally renowned vocal artist/ beatboxer/ musician/ comedian who wows audiences with his live performances which are 100% improvised.  Using his formidable voice, looping pedals, and his vast imagination, Reggie blends and blurs the lines between music and comedy.  No two performances are the same and to that end, ”genius” is the word most often used to describe Reggie Watts.  LA Weekly crowned him ”the most wildly inventive new talent of the past five years” while New York Magazine hailed Reggie as “Spectacularly original,” Rolling Stone featured him as “Hot Comedian,” SPIN named him as “Best New Comedian” and the LA Times praised Reggie is “a superstar.” 

On screen, in addition to his role as co-star on “Comedy Bang! Bang!”, his special "Reggie Watts:  A Live At Central Park" aired on Comedy Central in May 2012.  He also has appeared multiple times on Conan, and on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel Live, John Oliver’s Stand-Up New York, HBO’s The Yes Men Save The World, IFC, Comedy Central’s Michael and Michael Have Issues, UK’s "Funny Or Die," and PBS’ Electric Company.
