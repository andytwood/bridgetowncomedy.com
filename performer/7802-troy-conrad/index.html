An award winning filmmaker, comic, writer, and producer, the projects Troy has produced, directed have views in the millions.  He is creator and co-executive producer of the improvised stand-up show, Set List: Stand-Up Without A Net, currently airing on Sky Atlantic in the UK, as well as live in Los Angeles, the Comedy Cellar in New York City, and touring festivals worldwide.   He is the executive producer of The David Feldman Show on KPFK Pacifica Radio, and Director of the award winning film, â€œRunyon:  Just Above Sunset,&quot; starring Eddie Pepitone.  His new show, Prompter, is another way of making solo improvisation a meaningful experience for performers and audiences.

Having completed the writing programs at Second City Los Angeles Conservatory, iO West, and UCB Theatre,  he continues to create, write, and produce innovative new shows for stage and television.  As a comic, he performed at comedy clubs throughout the U.S., and festivals including Montreal, Dublin, Calgary, Vancouver, Edinburgh, Melbourne, Sydney, Austria, and London - as well as skeptic and atheist conferences throughout the world. Troy moved from Phoenix to Los Angeles in 2003 for the good soil to grow creative projects.
