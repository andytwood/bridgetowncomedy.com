Noah Gardenswartz was born and raised in Denver, Colorado, but spent years cutting his comedy teeth in the diverse rooms of Atlanta, Georgia. Noah now lives in Brooklyn, New York, and when he’s not touring, he performs all around the city, and co-hosts a monthly show called “Comedy Freaknik” at The Creek and the Cave. His comedy has been featured on TBS, Oxygen, Nat Geo TV, and in VICE Magazine. In 2012, Noah was named a semi-finalist in NBC’s “Stand Up For Diversity,” and in 2014 he was selected as one of the “New Faces” at the Montreal Just For Laughs Comedy Festival.
