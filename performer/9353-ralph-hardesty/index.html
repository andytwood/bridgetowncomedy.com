Ralph Hardesty is a die-hard Midwesterner who, after a series of indelible life mistakes, eventually wound up acting and doing standup in Austin, where Ralph is on 24/7 crotch watch (the straight guys in Texas do not wear underwear under their basketball shorts).

Hardesty has performed at festivals all over this great land including Fun Fun Fun Fest, Moontower Comedy &amp; Oddity Festival, Bridgetown Comedy Festival, the Ladies Are Funny Festival (though he is male, he is no less a lady) and the San Francisco Comedy &amp; Burrito Festival, which was delicious. Moms love him.
