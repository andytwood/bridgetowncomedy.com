Caitlin Weierhauser spent her childhood in an Ewok tree fort with her rubber band cross-bow, her wolf, and her budding resentment of The Man. She grew up to be a feminist, atheist, and vegan liar that creates safe spaces for queer comedy.

Caitlin is a member of Lez Stand Up, has performed on All Jane No Dick Comedy Festival, Grrrl Front, Not Enough! Fest, and won The Moth StorySLAM in December. She was recently included in the AfterEllen list of &quot;40 Hot Queer Ladies in Comedy,&quot; and plans to take down the patriarchy by Christmas.
