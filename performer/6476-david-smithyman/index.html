Failing to ever fulfill his true potential as a child actor, David Smithyman moved from Australia to New York City in 2004. Since then, he has performed in numerous showcases for IFC, MTV, and Comedy Central, in addition to representing NBC, first as a finalist in 2013&#039;s Stand Up For Diversity competition in Los Angeles, and then as a touring member of Stand Up NBC&#039;s national college tour. Currently, he works helping kids write their own stand-up at Gotham Comedy club as part of the Kids â€™n Comedy program.
