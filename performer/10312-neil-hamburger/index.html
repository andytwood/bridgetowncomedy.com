America’s Funnyman Neil Hamburger is the hardest working comedian in existence,  performing up to 399 shows a year internationally to critical acclaim and audience  bewilderment.  He’s toured as the hand-picked opener for Tenacious D, Tim &amp; Eric, and  Faith No More, and his TV credits include Fox News’ Red Eye, Tim and Eric Awesome  Show, Tom Green Live, and Jimmy Kimmel Live. On his 2011 UK tour Neil played to  packed houses at the Edinburgh Fringe and completed a 10-show stint at London’s Soho  Theatre. His most recent album “Live At Third Man” was produced by Jack White in  Nashville; an earlier Hamburger album was among SPIN’s “40 Greatest Comedy Albums  Of All Time.”
