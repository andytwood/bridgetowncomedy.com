Portland native, Gabe Dinger, has been making audiences laugh for the last 10 years. His sharp wit, irreverent observations, and ability to improvise make Gabe’s shows varied and exciting. He has performed at several comedy festivals, including: Bridgetown Comedy Festival, Bumbershoot, and SF Sketchfest. As a member of the improv troupe Whiskey Tango, he has also performed in the LA Improv Festival, SF Sketchfest, and the Del Close Marathon in New York City. More notably Gabe was the first comedian to perform at a high security prison in the state of Oregon. The Portland Mercury has called him a “Punchline machine”.
