Parker Postyeni is a Seattle stand-up comedian who definitely needs a more recent head shot who has been preforming all over the northwest for over 3 whole years! He first preformed in the Bridgetown comedy festival in 2013 and since has preformed in the Seattle international comedy competition, the San Francisco international comedy competition, and if you can believe it, actually won the 2014 Washington comedy festival! Know for having an intellect much higher than his energy level, and a voice far lower than his self esteems, Parker Postyeni is a comic he doesn&#039;t want you to miss!
