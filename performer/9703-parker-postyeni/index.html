Based out of Seattle, Parker Postyeni (who definitely needs a more recent head shot) has been preforming across the northwest for over 3 whole years! He first preformed at the Bridgetown comedy festival in 2013 and has since preformed in the Seattle international comedy competition, the San Francisco International Comedy Competition,  and won the 2014 Washington Comedy Festival! Know for having an intellect much higher than his energy level, and a voice far lower than his self esteems, Parker Postyeni is a comic he doesn&#039;t want you to miss!
