Beth Stelling had her network TV debut on Conan, appeared several times on Chelsea Lately&#039;s round table, won the internet on Comedy Central&#039;s @midnight with Chris Hardwick and performed on The Pete Holmes Show on TBS. Her debut album, Sweet Beth, has been named to countless top 10 lists.

LA Weekly named Stelling no. 2 on a list of “12 L.A. Comedy Acts to Watch in 2013.” Patton Oswalt listed Beth as one of his favorite up-and-coming comics during his AMA on Reddit. Buzzfeed.com says she’s one of “14 Comedians Who You Should Be Paying Attention To.” 

Beth was a New Face of Comedy at the Just for Laughs Comedy Festival in Montreal and returned to the festival last summer to record HBO Canada’s &quot;Funny As Hell&quot; with Jon Dore.

Beth was deemed one of the “Top 18 Women You Should Be Following On Twitter” by Huffington Post. Nerdist.com has been a big supporter of Beth, including her in their “Four Funny Female Comedians You Need to Know” alongside Shelby Fero, Tig Notaro and Ali Wong. Beth can be heard on Chris Hardwick’s annual podcast &quot;Stand-up Cluster 2013&quot; and with Pete Holmes on his podcast “You Made It Weird” #134.
