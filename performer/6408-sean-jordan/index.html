Sean Jordan is a stand up comedian originally from Sioux Falls SD.  Sean started into comedy after seeing only one stand up show.  Getting his start in Sioux Falls after winning a local comedy contest, Sean became one of the house emcees at the comedy club in town.  This gave Sean the chance to perform 3-4 times a week for years on end.  That opportunity allowed Sean to grow as a comedian at a very rapid rate while at the same time giving him all the stage time needed to develop a healthy confidence while telling jokes.  

After going as far as he could in Sioux Falls, Sean decided to move to Portland OR.  Quickly after moving he hopped right into the local scene advancing to the finals of the 2011 and 2012 Portland comedy competitions.  Sean was also voted one of Funny or Die and Splashlife magazines “30 Under 30” comedians to watch in 2011.  You have heard him as a repeat guest on Doug Bensons podcast “Doug Loves Movies” as well as “The Benson Interruption.”   You also may have seen him on Rooftop Comedy as a featured performer.  

He has participated in the Bridgetown Comedy Festival the last 4 years running as well as the Bumbershoot Comedy and Arts Festival for the last 2.  The easy and comfortable style of Sean is sure to put any audience member in the right frame of mind to enjoy a stand up show and also provide them with a memorable experience to keep them coming back.
