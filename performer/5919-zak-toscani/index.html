Zak Toscani is a Portland based comedian who performs regularly in the Pacific Northwest (Helium Comedy Club Portland, Seattle&#039;s Comedy Underground, Bumbershoot, Funny Over Everything). His style melts like an artisan cheese into both the honest and the silly, much like Dom DeLuise&#039;s lasagna recipe.
