Andy Wood is one of the only comedians to have performed in all eight years of the Bridgetown Comedy Festival, which he would like to think is unrelated to the fact that he's a co-founder and producer of said festival. He's also the co-host of the weekly podcast Probably Science, and he can be seen in the Comedy Central film Jason Nash Is Married and on the current season of MOCKpocalypse on AXS TV.
