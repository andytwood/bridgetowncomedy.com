I&#039;m not doing that 3rd person tense as if someone else wrote this.  I started out writing and acting but I always wanted to be funny. I love stand up.  I like to make it feel like we&#039;re in a bar or living room where you can talk shit about anything and make it funny.  I split my time between Vancouver and LA.  Most recently won 1st place in the 2015 Seattle International Comedy Competition. Stand up TV debut, coming soon on Comedy Central’s “Adam Devine’s House Party.”  I have opened up for Hannibal Burress, Reggie Watts and toured with Chris D&#039;elia on the “Under No Influence Tour.”  Produced my first comedy album Choosy Lover.
