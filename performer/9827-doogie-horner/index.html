Doogie Horner famously tamed a hostile NYC audience on America&#039;s Got Talent in 2009. He won Helium&#039;s Philly&#039;s Funniest contest in 2010 and was selected for the Oddball Festival in 2013. His show The Ministry of Secret Jokes won a Best of Philly award in 2011. He is the author of &quot;Everything Explained Through Flowcharts&quot; and &quot;100 Ghosts,&quot; and has written for McSweeney&#039;s, Wired, Playboy, Fast Company, the London Times, Boing Boing, and others.

&quot;Horner&#039;s delivery has a formal yet sing-song cadence to it that fits nicely into the way he delivers crafty one liners with nerd-like precision.&quot;
