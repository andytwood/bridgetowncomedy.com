Erin Gibson is an expert at mixing social commentary, political satire, and frank sexual talk into nice, neat little comedy packages. Based in Los Angeles, she currently writes and directs for Funny or Die and co-hosts the award winning comedy podcast "Throwing Shade", which is now a web series on Funny or Die and an international touring live show. 

As an actress and comedian, sheâ€™s been seen on Chelsea Lately, The Kroll Show, Parks and Rec, Community, Key and Peele, and clip shows galore, but it was her stint as host and writer of "Modern Lady" on CurrentTV that she became involved in the fun world of gender politics. 

Please do not startle her. She will scream.
