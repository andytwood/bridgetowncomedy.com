Bob Khosravi was born a baby, which his mother appreciated. A storyteller hailing from Austin, Texas Bob has performed all across the country as well as been a featured performer in the Moontower Comedy Festival, the Art Outside Comedy Festival, and was selected to compete in the San Francisco International Comedy Competition. An Austin favorite, Khosravi&#039;s comedy has been described as playful with a subtle sense of dark.
