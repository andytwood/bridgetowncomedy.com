Rob Schultz is a stand-up comedian in Los Angeles, CA who has performed at SF Sketchfest in 2013-15, the 2013 Sacramento Comedy Festival, a fish restaurant in Portland, OR, and at various Los Angeles landmarks with his traveling monthly show The Hike Mic. 

He is also the co-host of the weekly Gangbusters! Comedy Enjoyment Show, a submissions editor of the daily humor magazine TheHiggsWeldon.com, a member of the Upright Citizens Brigade&#039;s LA Digital group, and a video editor with credits on feature films, cable TV, and all manner of shorts and web things. And he still feels super lazy.
