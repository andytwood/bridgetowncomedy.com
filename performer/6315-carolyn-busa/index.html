Carolyn Busa has performed on stages all over Philadelphia and New York City, as well as the Ladies are Funny Festival, the Bridgetown Comedy Festival, the Women in Comedy Festival, and the She-Devil Comedy Festival. She is the proud mother/co-creator of Laughs on Fairmount, one of Philly&#039;s longest running open mics.

Carolynâ€™s awkwardly, disarming stage presence will charm your figurative pants off.  She continually hosts and features throughout the tri-state area; and contributes to local sketch and theater productions. She may have even unsuccessfully auditioned for &quot;America&#039;s Next Top Model.&quot; Twice.
