Chris Fairbanks’ album, “Fairbanks!” was named one of Amazon &amp; Amazon MP3s Top Ten of 2010. Fast paced, quirky, and constantly improvising his act, Chris Fairbanks delivers a truly unique self-observational style.

“He’s a master of controlled nervousness, almost jazz-like spontaneous prose, so free-flowing yet forward-moving it makes one wonder whether this is brilliant scripting or just damned good improv.” –Laughspin.

Chris has been seen on Conan, Jimmy Kimmel, VH1, Last Comic Standing, and Comedy Central.

…not to say he doesn’t deliver some hilarious jokes, it’s rather the real meat of his comedy comes more from something else: seemingly stream of consciousness comedic rambling. -Punchline Magazine
