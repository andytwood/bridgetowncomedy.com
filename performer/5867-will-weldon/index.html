Will Weldon is a comedian who currently resides in Los Angeles, California, home to such luminaries as Jeremy Piven and that&#039;s pretty much it. He has performed on such well known Los Angeles comedy shows as The Meltdown with Jonah and Kumail, Put Your Hands Together, and the now defunct (what a great word) Holy Fuck! He has toured across the country, as well as appearing at both the Bridgetown and Montreal Comedy festivals, where he was invited to perform on a “Best of the Fest” showcase. He has been written about in the kinds of online comedy magazines only other comedians ever read, and was catfished by someone he met on Twitter. Try to keep that last thing a secret, though.
