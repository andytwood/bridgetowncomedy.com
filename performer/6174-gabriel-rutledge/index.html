Since abandoning his successful pizza delivery career in 2000, Gabriel&#039;s talent, hard work, and lack of a fall back plan have made him into one of North America&#039;s finest touring comics.

He is also a frequent guest on the Bob and Tom radio show, heard in over 150 cities.

Gabriel has performed at the HBO/TBS Comedy Festival in Las Vegas, the Laughing Skull Comedy Festival in Atlanta, and The Great American Comedy Festival held in Johnny Carson&#039;s home town of Norfolk Nebraska.

He has made at least 4 people pee their pants.

Gabriel&#039;s has released two albums; &quot;Sometimes Laughter Hurts&quot; and &quot;Breeder&quot; that can be heard on Sirius Satellite Radio, 24/7 Comedy Radio, and wherever you want if you buy one. Rutledge makes his home in one of the great entertainment capitals of the world; Olympia Washington.
