Rachel Dratch was a cast member on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; for 7 years. Before that she was on the Mainstage of Second City Chicago for four years, where she wrote and performed with Adam McKay, Scott Adsit, and Tina Fey.  She appeared in a bunch of TV shows, including &quot;King of Queens&quot; where she had a recurring role as Patton Oswalt&#039;s girlfriend. She&#039;s been in a bunch of movies, most of which are with Adam Sandler.  Rachel is really into name-dropping. 

Her book, &quot;Girl Walks into a Bar&quot; was published by Gotham. Thank you, and have a wonderful day.
