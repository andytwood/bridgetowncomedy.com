Brandy Feit (named after that song about a woman who attracts men that rather be married to a body of water), first honed her comedy skills in efforts to hang out with her own family as a young child.

She started stand-up after finishing her BS in Public Affairs/Non-Profit Management. She figured out she could help a lot more people through way of laughter.

A Portland based comedian, she runs two monthly showcases - Single Cycle at SPIN Laundry Lounge with co-host Chase Brockett and Comedy and Cocktails at New Deal Distillery with co-host Jason Traeger - and performs in local showcases. She is part of the local cocktail scene as a bartender at Pepe Le Moko. She enjoys creating and using songs, videos and satire to her compliment her comedic style. She started a podcast called “Sincerest Unapologies” where she discusses topics that affect her community, like procrastination and tolerance.
