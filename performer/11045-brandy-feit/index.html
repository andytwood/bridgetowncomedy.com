Brandy Feit was named after the song “Brandy (you’re a fine girl)” by Looking Glass in Chicago, Illinois. Her earliest memories were at 3 years old and includes her blowing out her big bird birthday cake and her panic attack at age 4. She quit smoking at age 7. She wanted to do standup comedy since third grade and being called funny is still the best compliment she could ever hear. She studied nonprofit management &amp; public affairs at Indiana University and she wishes she studied journalism if anything at all, but she thought that was practical at the time. Follow your dreams kids. She greatly cocktails and works in the spirits industry. She aspires to be famous or at least revered in some way so she can sleep with younger men and live abroad if her potential husband dies too prematurely. She has never killed anyone.
