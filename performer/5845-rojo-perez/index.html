Rojo Perez is a New York based comedian. He grew up in Puerto Rico, which helped him form the humor you see in him today. After moving to Florida for college, he began doing stand up at the age of 20 in local clubs and small café’s in Central Florida. Since moving to the Northeast, Rojo has become a regular in the NY comedy scene and can usually be seen performing at The Creek and The Cave. He has also performed at Caroline’s, The Comedy Studio, The Improv, the UCB theaters and many other clubs around the US. He has appeared on &quot;Keith and The Girl&quot; and has been featured at the New York Comedy Festival and at the inaugural LA Riot Comedy Festival. His future plans include one day earning enough money that relatives will ask to borrow and continuing to spread laughter regardless of race, religion and gender.
