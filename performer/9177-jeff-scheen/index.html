Jeff Scheen is a comedian and writer who grew up in remote Holly, Michigan and began his career in Detroit. Since moving to Chicago, Jeff has become a regular at the Chicago Laugh Factory, Zanies, and several independent comedian run shows including his own &quot;This Weeks Show&quot; in Wrigleyville.

     His off beat humor goes along nicely with his expressive yet creepy face. Growing up in northern Michigan surrounded by trees and dirt roads will make any kid a weirdo and Jeff has no problem telling you about it. Jeff has showcased at numerous theaters and festivals including The Cleveland Comedy Festival, Laugh your Asheville off in North Carolina, and Laughfest in Grand rapids Michigan.
