Sandra Daugherty punches sexual shame in the face. The sex educator is a firm believer in the right to healthy intimate experiences and the skills that get us there.

Sandra is known the world over for her podcast, “Sex Nerd Sandra.” At once irreverent and educational, the show has earned a top spot on iTunes. Its loyal listenership (over 9 million downloads) is vocal about Sandra’s impact, describing her as “inspiring” with “contagious enthusiasm” and an “awesome nerd-like ability that [she’s] not afraid to show.” Her weekly podcast has run since 2011 under the Nerdist Industries banner with no end in sight.

Her professional journey began in 2009 normalizing sexuality through sex-positive workshops and she continues to teach as well as appearing across other platforms including web and TV shows, podcasts, documentaries, panels, lectures, personal coaching and consulting.

Her background in cultural anthropology, philosophy and broadcast journalism provide crucial lenses through which she views her work. Sandra has completed the comprehensive sex educator training program provided by San Francisco Sex Information (SFSI), attends professional conferences and workshops regularly and devours literature on all related topics with retention equal to her curiosity.

 Brimming with book smarts and street smarts, Sandra is passionately committed to creating a safe space for each person’s unique intimate needs. Her methods include heavy doses of physical comedy, playful insight and surprising disclosure.

Born and raised in Los Angeles, she is an avid traveler and lover of big questions.
