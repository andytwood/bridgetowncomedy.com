Casey Ley’s comedy is silly. And smart. And dirty. And dark. And handsome. It’s a lot like him actually.  So it is also self-centered and flakey and relatively promiscuous.  He is the creator and host of the popular San Francisco comedy game show &quot;Tonic Trivia&quot; and stand-up show &quot;Some People Like Us.&quot;  He and his shows have appeared in comedy festivals like SF Sketchfest, Moontower Festival in Austin, TX, on the radio on the relatively popular NPR station, and he has shared the stage with comics you know like Hannibal Buress, Doug Benson, Laura Kightlinger and some other people you&#039;ve heard of if you like comedy.  The readers of SF Weekly voted him best comic in San Francisco in 2012 (which had nothing to do with his homosexuality), and in 2013 he was runner-up in The Advocate Magazine&#039;s Next Great Queer Comedy competition (which was wholly the result of his homosexuality).  Apparently he just wasn&#039;t quite gay enough.  Last year, at least.
