Originally from Seattle, Jak Knight performed 2 times before knowing it was time to pack up all his possessions and move to Los Angeles permanently to pursue stand-up comedy.  Now he uses his charming demeanor and street smarts to navigate the comedy scene. Jak recently wrote for the ADHD animated series THE LUCAS BROS. MOVING COMPANY and was recently named a Comedy Central Comic to Watch in 2014.
