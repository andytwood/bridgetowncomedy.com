Traveling across Canada, the U.S and the Middle East she covers a wide range of topics,

from how lesbians are the new gentlemen to her parents’ wedding anniversary landing on, you

guessed it, September 11th.

She has just launched the *podcast Unheard Of: Sex, Religion and Politics at the Dinner Table. (https://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/unheard-of/id1039645794?mt=2) Interviewing a wide range of ordinary people with unconventional lives. Her guests vary from a former Jehovah’s Witness, to people who are transgender and asexual, to a convert to Islam and a porn actor, to name a few.
