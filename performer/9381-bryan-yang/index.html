Bryan Yang is a stand up comedian based in New York City. He’s originally from Sacramento, CA where he began his comedy career. Yang relocated to New York because he heard there was a pretty good comedy scene there. 

Bryan was named one of Buzzfeed’s &quot;Top 14 Comedians You Should Be Paying Attention To.&quot; He was number 12 on the list, so he barely made it. 

Some of the places Yang has performed at include the Sacramento Punchline, San Francisco Punchline, Cobb’s Comedy Club, Gotham Comedy Club, and the UCB Theatre. He mostly performs in the basement of bars though. There were too many bars to list.
