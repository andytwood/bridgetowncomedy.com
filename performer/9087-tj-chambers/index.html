The previous year was a breakout one for this delightfully scruffy Los Angeles-based writer and performer.  Mr. Chambers made his (international!) television debut on Channel Four&#039;s massively popular special &quot;50 Funniest Moments of 2014&quot;, worked as writer and producer for shows on Fox, NBC, and Lifetime, and was a regular fixture on some of comedy&#039;s most nerve-wracking shows like Setlist and Competitive Erotic Fan Fiction.  One time he even successfully pulled off the rare triple-denim (jeans, jean shirt, denim jacket) vaulting him into minor celebrity in the tight-knit (pun intended) denim world.  Appearances at San Diego Comic-Con, Stan Lee&#039;s Comikaze, and his role as one of the Kings of Cosplay Comedy justified a lot of pre-teen nerdery, and his combination of edgy smarts with a dash of whimsy entertained audiences at home and abroad.  Also, you know, he&#039;s generally a nice dude or whatever.
