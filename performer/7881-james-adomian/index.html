James Adomian is a daredevil dancing queen  — but don’t you know deep down he’s just a kitten? James was a top-10 finalist on NBC's Last Comic Standing and is a frequent guest on Comedy Bang Bang and other wild podcasts. He performs standup and characters live at Upright Citizens Brigade and at festivals, theatres, dive bars, party schools and radical political events across North America. His debut album Low Hangin Fruit was released by Earwolf in August 2012.
