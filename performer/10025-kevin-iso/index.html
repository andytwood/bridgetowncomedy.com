Originally from Houston, Kevin Iso began performing stand up all across Texas before moving to New York where he has been honing his skills. As a true student of the game Kevin displays likeability and poise way beyond the years of a 22-year-old. Through his unique point of view, Kevin seamlessly blends cultures while appealing to all ages. This past year Kevin has performed at the Montreux Comedy Festival in Switzerland, the Funny or Die Oddball Festival, Comedy Central&#039;s Comics To Watch and will be featured on Axs TV&#039;s Gotham Comedy Live. He can currently be seen at premier clubs like Stand Up NY, Caroline&#039;s on Broadway and The Stand, as well as colleges across the country. On top of performing stand up, Kevin is the Co-Creator of the hit web-series Moderately Funny.
