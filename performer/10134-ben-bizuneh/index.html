Ben started doing stand-up in Bloomington, Indiana at the Comedy Attic, and moved to Los Angeles in the summer of 2012. Heâ€™s performed at the Limestone Comedy Festival, was a finalist in the Great American Comedy Festival, and most recently performed at the 2014 Bridgetown Comedy Festival. 

Ben is the creator of the YouTube channel, LieGuys, where he makes videos in which he lies to people with his friends (mostly Aristotle Georgeson). LieGuys has been featured on Sourcefed, Elite Daily, WorldStarHipHop, Mic, Racialicious, College Humor, and The Bleacher Report. Ben hopes to one day be able to cry on command.
