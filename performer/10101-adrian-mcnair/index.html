Adrian McNair is a San Francisco/Bay Area-based stand-up comic. He considers himself intelligent, though he can’t find a better way to put a degree from UC Berkeley to good use. He has been featured in SF Sketchfest, hosts the weekly Laugh Function Comedy Showcase in Berkeley and independently produces “The Book Was Better” Comedy Night in Oakland.
