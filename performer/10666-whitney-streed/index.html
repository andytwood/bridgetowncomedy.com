Whitney Streed is a comedian because if she was not, her incessant punning would have no artistic or monetary value whatsoever. Whitney performs stand-up comedy all around the Pacific Northwest and has featured for Maria Bamford, Rob Delaney, Jackie Kashian, and other rad folks. Festival appearances include Seattle Sketchfest, All Jane No Dick in Portland, and the Salt Lake City Comedy Carnivale, as well as Portland's Bridgetown Comedy Festival both as a performer and, since 2012, a producer. Whitney hosts and produces shows all over Portland and can seen playing a feminist and potential home-buyer on three seasons of IFCâ€™s hit show "Portlandia."

Whitney Streed cares about you and wants you to be happy.
