Whitney Streed is a comedian because it is the only way to make stupid puns seem like art. Whitney performs stand-up in and around the Pacific Northwest and has featured for Maria Bamford, Rob Delaney, Jackie Kashian, and other rad folks. Festival appearances include Seattle Sketchfest, All Jane No Dick in Portland, and the Salt Lake City Comedy Carnivale, as well as Portland's Bridgetown Comedy Festival both as a performer and, since 2013, a producer. Whitney hosts and produces shows all over Portland and can seen playing a feminist and potential home-buyer on three seasons of IFCâ€™s hit show "Portlandia."

Whitney Streed cares about you and wants you to be happy.
