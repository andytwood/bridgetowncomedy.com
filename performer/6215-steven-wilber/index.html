&quot;Offbeat,&quot; &quot;unexpected&quot; and &quot;clever&quot; are just three of literally hundreds of words used to describe the comedy-style stylings of Steven Wilber. Since starting stand-up in 2011, Steven has risen up in the Portland comedy scene to become a frequent performer at arcade bars, anarchist bookstores, Doctor Who-themed seafood restaurants and other typical comedy venues this city has to offer.

Steven has shared the stage with Chris Hardwick, Mary Lynn Rajskub, Sean Patton and Ron Funches...whether they wanted him to or not. He has performed at Bumbershoot,  the Savage Henry comedy festival, has been featured on Bryan Cook&#039;s Competitive Erotic Fan Fiction podcast, and is a writer for The Spicy News web series.

He also has over 23,000 Vine followers, which he&#039;s been told is a good thing to include in a bio.
