Myq Kaplan is a comedian named Mike Kaplan.

He has been seen on the Tonight Show with Conan O&#039;Brien, the Late Show with David Letterman, and in his own half-hour Comedy Central Presents special. He has been heard on his albums &quot;Meat Robot&quot; and &quot;Vegan Mind Meld,&quot; his podcast, &quot;Hang Out With Me&quot; on the Keith and The Girl network, and also thousands of other podcasts and things that aren&#039;t podcasts. In addition to being seen and heard, he has been smelled and tasted and touched. This May, his one-hour special, &quot;Small, Dork, and Handsome,&quot; will debut on Netflix, and all kinds of other things will probably happen in the future, but bios are mainly about the past.
