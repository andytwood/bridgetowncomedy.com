This is more of an AutoBio than a Bio. The truth is most comedians write their own bios. I’m not judging. It’s a lot easier to brag about one’s own accomplishments while hiding behind third person. They are very well written. It seems comedians either 1. Have a Masters in English, or 2. A Thesaurus, and a lot of free time. I have neither.

The truth is I’d rather you come see me to check it out for yourself. To get you to the club I’ll tell you this:

2004	Just for Laughs Comedy Festival New Faces	Montreal

2004	Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn	CBS

2006	Live at Gotham	Comedy Central

2007	Comedy Central Presents Chad Daniels	Comedy Central

2009	Aspen Comedy Festival winner &quot;Comics Comic&quot;	Aspen, CO

2009	Tonight Show with Conan O&#039;Brien	NBC

2010	Just for Laughs Comedy Festival Masters Showcase	Montreal

2012	Gilda&#039;s Laughfest Comedy Competition 1st Place	Grand Rapids

2012	Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson	CBS

2012	Conan O&#039;Brien Show	TBS

I’m funny. If you’re still not willing to come to a show you’re just being difficult.
