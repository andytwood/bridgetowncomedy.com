Erin McGathy is a comedian, writer, and inspiration* living all of the dreams in Los Angeles. As a Navy Kid who moved around a lot, she's willing to do just about anything to make you like her. She's like, SO much fun, you guys!!!

Erin has proudly performed at the UCB theatre since 2007 with Harold and Maude teams, in sketch shows, variety shows and in other charmingly unclassifiable performances. She is the creator and host of THIS FEELS TERRIBLE: The Love Show, a UCBTLA live show since 2010 and podcast since 2012 (feralaudio.com).

When she's not doing comedy related things she's making "Ugly Cakes" for buddies and mediocre paintings for cold hard cash.

*JK. What if someone really described herself as an "inspiration"???
