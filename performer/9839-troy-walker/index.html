If you haven&#039;t heard yet, the Denver comedy scene is blowing up and comedian Troy Walker is one of the most talented local rising stars.

Troy Walker has quickly become one of Denver&#039;s most sought-after comedians, a designation he&#039;d dismiss with a modest scoff, despite its accuracy. A regular at Comedy Works, Walker has won the Comedy Works &quot;New Faces&quot; contest twice.

Walker has had the pleasure of opening for some of the most prominent comedians in the country and also serves as a fine ambassador of Denver comedy at national and local comedy festivals including The Aspen Rooftop Comedy Festival, The Great American Comedy Festival, The Laughing Skull Comedy Festival, Portland&#039;s Bridgetown Comedy Festival, The Telluride Comedy Festival, and most recently as one of Just for Laughs Montreal&#039;s New Faces of Comedy.

After witnessing his storytelling abilities and commanding presence on-stage it should come as no surprise that he&#039;s also a licensed attorney who graduated from The University of Denver&#039;s Sturm College of Law.
