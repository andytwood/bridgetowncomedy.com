Ian Abramson is from Moreno Valley, California, where he learned to walk, read, and drive, but not in that order. He studied theater at California State University Channel Islands, which isn’t on an island, but has been converted from an old mental hospital, so it’s isolated in its own way.  While at school, he took as many performance and writing classes as he could and after trying stand-up at a couple of campus open mics, he decided to start writing comedy.  After finishing school, he briefly lived in Orange County, launching his standup career.

In search of the best comedy training, Ian moved to Chicago where he began taking improv classes at The Second City and the iO Theatre.  With comic friend Tim Barnes, he co-created The Pitch and Talent Scout’s Honor, both web series for Tom Snyder (of Dr. Katz fame).  Over the course of a year and a half, they made over 50 weekly episodes. Working again with Snyder, he voiced an episode of the producer/writer’s Explosion Bus, featured alongside Daryl Hall of “Hall and Oates.”  Ian is well known for producing events such as A Funeral for a Prop Comic and A Court Case for a Young Comedian.  He insists these are not comedy shows.  He is also a regular contributor for The Onion. 

Ian’s stand-up has evolved into a mix of precise wordplay, longer emotionally absurd jokes, and larger conceptual pieces.  In the past year, Ian has performed at the Oddball Comedy Festival, UP Comedy Club, Milwaukee’s Comedy Cafe, The Lincoln Lodge.  His Seven Minutes in Purgatory is an experimental show where comedians perform to a camera in one room while the audience watches in another room, resulting in the comics having no idea of how they are doing. Chicago Magazine named Ian “Best Experimental Comedian” and also listed him in a separate article as one of the “16 Comedians You Should See This Fall.”  Ian has made Appearances at Funny or Die&#039;s Oddball Festival and the Chicago Comedy Exposition. He has featured for Dave Hill and Bridget Everett at UP Comedy Club and Jimmy Pardo at Jukebox Comedy Club.
