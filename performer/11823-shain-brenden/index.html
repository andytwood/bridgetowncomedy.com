Shain Brenden is a comedian, writer, and full-time handsome person based in Los Angeles, California. He began his comedy career Christmas Day on a small military outpost in Afghanistan making his buddies laugh during a &quot;talent show&quot; for the troops (Shain included...he was a troop). He traded in his uniform and health care benefits for open mics and free chicken tenders and only regrets it sometimes when it’s late and he can’t sleep. His comedy reads like a page out of his private journal, taking stories of his family, failed relationships, and fleeting youth to deliver them with wit, charm and lots of lying. He&#039;s a good boy that tries his best everyday.
