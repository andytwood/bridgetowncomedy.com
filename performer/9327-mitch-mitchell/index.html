Originally from a census-designated place in Montana, Mitch Mitchell dropped out of art school after two semesters and got a job on an ambulance. With an offbeat sense of humor and a healthy variety of jokes, Mitch has been seen performing at Bumbershoot and the Seattle International Comedy Competition as well as an assortment of poorly lit restaurants, bars and basements in the greater Seattle area and Portland.
