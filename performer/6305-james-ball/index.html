Dry, dark, and delightful, this Canadian comic has performed his laidback brand of one-liner standup on stages across Canada and in the UK. 

Watching him, you may be reminded of The Far Side, smooth jazz, and a book of insane haiku. 

Credits include Just For Laughs, the Halifax Comedy Festival, the Manchester Comedy Festival, and the Blue Bridge Comedy Festival. His half-hour Comedy Now TV special continues to air across Canada a little too frequently for his comfort. You can also hear him on XM Satellite radio from time to time. 

James was born and raised in Victoria BC, made his standup debut in Tokyo, and did his first paid gig in Alberta. He lives in Victoria today where he works in media and performs &amp; produces comedy shows up and down Vancouver Island. This is his first appearance in the States. 

Tall yet approachable, James is thrilled to be at Bridgetown. Ask him about motorcycles, the Toronto Raptors, his favorite podcasts, and Victoria&#039;s best microbrewed beers. He knows things.
