A Chicago-based stand-up comic who performs regularly in showcases around the cityâ€”especially showcases in record shops and bookstores. A trained actor and improvisor, Lucas began stand-up in college, and after a brief period of actually earning a living as a copywriter, he committed to stand-up full-time. And the rest is poverty.  Funny poverty.
