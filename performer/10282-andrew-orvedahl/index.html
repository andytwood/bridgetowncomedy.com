Andrew Orvedahl is a comedian and person currently based in Denver, Colorado. If you were a comedy sommelier, you might say his comedy is somewhat cerebral, with a dry finish and floral notes of sarcasm. He prefers mixing real-life stories with creative (and often improvised) observations within those stories. He is a regular at his home club, the renowned Comedy Works in Denver, and has performed at the Montreal Just for Laughs, Bridgetown, Aspen, Las Vegas, Seattle, and Great American comedy festivals.

Andrew is 1/3 of Denver’s comedy supergroup The Grawlix, who sold their sitcom pilot ‘Those Who Can’t’ to Amazon Studios in 2012. Andrew co-created, co-wrote, and co-starred in the pilot, which debuted in April of 2013.

Andrew has appeared on Nickmom’s ‘Night Out’, ‘Last Comic Standing’, on Comedy Central’s website, and on Sirius XM radio.In 2014, Andrew made his late night debut on &#039;The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon&#039;. In 2013, Andrew released his debut comedy album ‘Hit the Dick Lights‘ on Greater Than Records, which was named one of the top 10 comedy specials of 2013 by Time Out New York. In 2012, Andrew was awarded Denver’s prestigious ‘Mastermind’ award for his support of comedy culture in the city.

In 2010, Andrew created the hit storytelling show and podcast The Narrators, which he continues to co-host monthly.

In 2013, Andrew created The Unicorn podcast, where he and his co-host Talitha talk invite comedians to talk about sex and relationships.

When he isn’t performing comedy Andrew can be found playing with Legos, riding bikes, and doing really fun stuff with his daughter.
