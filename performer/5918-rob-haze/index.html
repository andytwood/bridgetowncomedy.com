In a short amount of time, Rob Haze has become a rising star in stand up comedy.  The Atlanta native began his stand up journey while studying Political Science at the University of Georgia. There he would host and perform at many talent shows, pageants, and step shows. He went on to win the Athens Last Comic Standing contest. With a sense of humor that is full both of clever wordplay and references to popular culture, there is no wonder why Rob has become a favorite at the Laughing Skull Lounge, Punchline, and Uptown Comedy Corner.  Rob uses his gift to help others as well. In 2012, he won the Autism Laughs charity competition. He also was a writer and star of a (local) sketch comedy show called Cabbagetown. In 2012, Rob began to branch out from the Southeast, and was a finalist in the Bay Area Black Comedy Competition in Oakland, California.  He was a 2013 Finalist in the NBC Stand up for Diversity competition and is currently on their college tour. Rob has opened for many comics including Donnell Rawlins, Hannibal Buress, and most recently Dave Chappelle.
