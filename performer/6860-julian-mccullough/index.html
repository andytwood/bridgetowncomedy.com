You may recognize Julian from a variety of basic cable shows that constantly run his episodes without paying him residuals because life isn't fair. These shows include Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, Chelsea Lately, Guy Code, Love You, Mean It with Whitney Cummings, and Comedy Central Presents. There is a reason Julian is on TV so much, and that is because he is a super fun hang! Man that guy is funny. On and off stage, he really is a great time!
