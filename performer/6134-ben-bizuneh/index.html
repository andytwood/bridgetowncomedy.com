Ben started doing stand-up in Bloomington, Indiana at the Comedy Attic while attending Indiana University. After graduating, he moved to Los Angeles, and can be seen performing wherever anyone will let him. He’s performed at the Limestone Comedy Festival, was a finalist in the Great American Comedy Festival, and has done no other festivals.

He also makes videos in which he lies to people that have been featured on WorldStarHipHop, College Humor, What’s Trending, and The Bleacher Report. Ben hopes to one day be able to cry on command.
