The easiest way to describe Sean Flannery is: he&#039;s attended the wrong wedding (twice). That mostly sums it up.

On stage, he shares wild, hilarious stories, while showing multimedia from the events: photos, videos, voicemails and more. He recently combined many of these stories into a sold-out, critically-acclaimed one man show, called &quot;Never Been to Paris,&quot; about the last 10 times he nearly killed himself by accident.

He is also the creator and host of &quot;The Blackout Diaries,&quot; a show where comics plus &#039;real&#039; people (cops, priests, teachers, etc) share true drinking stories and answer questions from the audience.

He has been named the best comic in Chicago by several publications and his live multimedia shows

routinely sellout. He was a featured New Face at Just For Laughs Comedy Festival (Montreal)

and made his television debut last year, on Comedy Central&#039;s, ”Mashup”.
