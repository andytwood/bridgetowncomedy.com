Half shark alligator, half man, Jacob Christopher has been seen and heard all across the Pacific NW, sharing his stories with the masses. Starting his comedy career in 2010, Jacob has become a regular working comic at Helium and Harveys, and has also been featured in many great Portland showcases such as Midnight Mass, Spicy News, Tonic, Fly Ass Jokes, and more. With his unique story telling, he shares tales of triumph and tragedy, good times and hardships, and takes the audience on an emotional roller coaster that will leave you wanting more. Please keep your arms and legs inside the ride and remain seated until he comes to a full stop. If you are breast feeding or pregnant, you may want to consult a physician prior to hearing him.
