Ben Roy started in the world of standup comedy when he entered a Denver, Colorado Comedy Works new talent night in early 2004. After an impressive showing, a manager snuck him into a professional competition a few months later, where he placed second to comedian Josh Blue, who would go onto national fame as winner of Last Comic Standing. 

In the summer of 2010, Roy was invited to perform in the &quot;New Faces&quot; division of the Montreal Just for Laughs Comedy Festival. After standout performances that year, he was invited back for its 2012 Nasty Show as well as in 2014 to headline his own hour shows. He&#039;s appeared on HBO&#039;s Funny as Hell series, Comedy Central&#039;s Adam Devine&#039;s House Party, Gotham Comedy Live, NickMom Night Out, and was featured in the book Mock Stars: Indie Comedy and Dangerously Funny (alongside comedy greats like Patton Oswalt and Fred Armisen). 

Ben&#039;s debut standup album, I Got Demons, was released in 2012 and ranked one of the 10 Best Comedy Albums of the year by Laughspin. His second standup album, No Enlightenment in Sobriety, was released April 15, 2014 and peaked at #2 on the iTunes charts. He is also part of the The Grawlix, a Denver based comedy troupe that has filmed TV pilots for Amazon Studios and truTV. 

Ben sings for punk band SPELLS, and had the rare honor of being an official invite to the South by Southwest music festival as both a comic and musician.
