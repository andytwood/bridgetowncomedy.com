David Zoe Leon began his comedy career in Madison, WI and is currently living in Chicago, IL. David has shared the stage with many talented performers such as Emo Phillips, Bobcat Goldthwait, and T.J. Miller. David Leon&#039;s style of comedy, best described by the Onion A.V. club, &quot;plays on the yearning sentimentalist and inner-creep&quot; with a &quot;kid-on-sugar-high stage presence.&quot; David has performed at comedy clubs all over the country as well as festivals such as Bumbershoot Music &amp; Arts festival, Bridgetown Comedy Festival, the Chicago Comedy Exposition and the world&#039;s biggest bratwurst festival Brat Fest in Madison,WI. With a demented persona and unpredictable topics, David Leon puts on a show that demands intensity and imagination from his audience, all while having a smile on his face and a mustache on his heart.

&quot;David Zoe Leon is my new favorite person.&quot;- Portland Mercury
