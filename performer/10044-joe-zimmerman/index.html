In 2013 Joe Zimmerman made his television debut on Comedy Central&#039;s John Oliver&#039;s New York Stand Up Show, and since then has appeared on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, Season 8 of Last Comic Standing, Nickelodeon, and recorded a Half Hour Special with Comedy Central. He was also chosen as one of the acclaimed New Faces at Just For Laughs Montreal, where he was positively reviewed by the The Spit Take and Time Out NY. In 2014, he recorded his debut solo album, Smiling at Wolves, and Buzzfeed named him one of the comedians you should be paying attention to, saying, &quot;The combination of Joe&#039;s calming vocalization and inventive writing is a thing of magic,&quot; and &quot;You&#039;d be hard pressed to find a more enjoyable show.&quot;

Praised for an accessible style pairing absurdism with a wide-eyed, aw-shucks demeanor, Joe is an original member of the Beards of Comedy, who toured from 2008-2012 and released two albums (2011&#039;s Cardio Mix with Comedy Central Records &amp; 2009&#039;s Comedy For People with Rooftop Records).

Currently Joe is touring the country working on his new hour, and has a comedy-science podcast called Universe City with new episodes every Tuesday. Joe grew up in West Virginia and started comedy in North Carolina shortly after graduating from Davidson College. He now lives in New York City where he hosts a weekly Wednesday show in Brooklyn called Hot Crowd.
