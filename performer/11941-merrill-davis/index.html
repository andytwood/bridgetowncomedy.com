Merrillâ€™s comedy brings a sense of wisdom, self-effacing charm, and silliness to the stage; much like a nanny who&#039;s just seen &quot;Adventures In Babysitting&quot;, and knows not to emulate the movie&#039;s plot but wants to just for fun.

She&#039;s lovable and and enjoys animals at all times. Merrill has been featured in Another Period on Comedy Central, Comedy Dynamics on Hulu, Still Punching The Clown with Henry Phillips, and Image Doctors on Funny or Die. She regularly features for friends Jamie Lee and Debra DiGiovanni at The Irvine Improv, The Hollywood Improv and UCB.  She&#039;s performed all over Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Atlanta, and other cities you&#039;ve heard of.  She performs regularly at Upright Citizens Brigade Theater in shows like Fresh Out with Emily Heller and Adam Conover, Crash Test with Paul Scheer and Rob Huebel and other great shows around town.

Additionally, she currently co-produces three popular shows in LA, Witch Hunt at The Virgil with Debra DiGiovanni, Rendezvous with Jazz Ponce at The Hollywood Improv Lab, and FUN! with Ashley Hamilton.

Come see Merrill soon. She would appreciate it. But seriously she would love to see you and would want you to break all your plans even if you don&#039;t have any.
