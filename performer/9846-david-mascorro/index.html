David Mascorro has an unrelenting, energetic soul. David started his pursuit of comedy in Chicago, and went through improv training at the Annoyance Theater and Second City before turning his sights on stand-up. 

David draws people in with his natural charisma, while proceeding to keep the laughs going with an infectious energy. When audiences hear David tell personal stories from his life, they instantly feel connected to him like a long lost friend. 

David is currently based out of Portland, OR and has quickly become a local favorite on the scene. He produces multiple showcases, including Funny Humans Vs The Wheel (a comedy game show) and The Awkward Phase, a storytelling show/podcast about childhood memories.
