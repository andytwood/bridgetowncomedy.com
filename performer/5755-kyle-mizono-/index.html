Originally from San Francisco, Kyle Mizono is a comedian and one of the last international Beanie Baby collectors. Along with being a regular performer in San Francisco and Los Angeles, her festival performances include Edinburgh Fringe and Portland’s All Jane No Dick festival. Currently, Kyle is the Junior Producer of The Super Serious Show. Her comedy was once described as a “breath of fresh air” but she prefers to be described as a “tall glass of piping hot water.”
