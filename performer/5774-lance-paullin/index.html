Lance Paullin is a loveable white guy with pretty, black lady hair living in the slums of Los Angeles where he tells PRETTY DECENT jokes and acts for television/cinema films. He&#039;s never been arrested; therefore, he has no prior arrests. He&#039;s a good guy. He wrote this specifically for you.
